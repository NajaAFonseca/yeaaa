<h1 id="questionsdifficulties-within-the-quiz"><strong>Questions/Difficulties within the Quiz</strong></h1>

<h4 id="collaboration-quiz"><strong>Collaboration Quiz</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Q3 User participation in software development</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>N/A, missed question was understandibly incorrect.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="program-design-and-development-quiz"><strong>Program Design and Development Quiz</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Q1 Documentation for procedure with a loop</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If I knew how to add, I would of gotten this right. Who knew 1+2 would end up in continuos odd numbers. WHAT IF, one of them was even… this hypothetical leads to me being right.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q2 Documentation for procedure with add and div</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>How was I supposed to know that a number divided by 0 would come out as an error? I was not informed that comp sci was a math class. If I was, I would of had these skills available to solve the question AND would of gotten it right.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="program-function-and-purpose-quiz"><strong>Program Function and Purpose Quiz</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Q1 Behavior of code that multiplies inside a loop</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Again, with the mathematics, if I was aware, IF, I would of aced this quiz.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q2 Behavior of mystery procedure with if statement</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Where does the values of true and false come out? Is this a boolean statement? How was I supposed to tell if it was?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q5 How nested loops with lists function</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Makes sense. Would of gotten it right though. Probably just a misclick not gonna lie.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q6 Inputs provided by customer on food delivery app</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>I thought that the question meant, the credit card or payment info for the purchaser as in the customer giving payment info to the cashregister. If I was an English Major, I would’ve been able to read. Actually, I wouldn’t even be illeterate. Clearly, a question issue, I’m all good though.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Develop a program using a development process.</li>
  <li>Design a program and its user interface.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="essential-knowledge">Essential Knowledge</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature.</li>
  <li>There ar emultiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program:
    <ul>
      <li>investigation and reglecting</li>
      <li>designing</li>
      <li>prototyping</li>
      <li>testing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process.</li>
  <li>A development process that is incrememntal is one that breaks the problem in to smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole.</li>
  <li>The design of a program incoroporates investigation to determine its requirements.</li>
  <li>Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraits, as well as the concerns and interests of the people hwo will use the program.</li>
  <li>Some ways investigation can be [erformed are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>collecting data through surveys</li>
      <li>user testing</li>
      <li>interviews</li>
      <li>direct observations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide.</li>
  <li>A program’s specification defines the requirements for the program.</li>
  <li>In a development process, the dsign phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification.</li>
  <li>The design phase of a program may include:
    <ul>
      <li>brainstorming</li>
      <li>planning and storyboarding</li>
      <li>organizing the program into modules and funtional components</li>
      <li>creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface</li>
      <li>development of a testing strategy for the program</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-is-a-program-developed">How is a program developed?</h4>
<p>It starts with an idea.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind.</li>
  <li>Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan.</li>
  <li>Sometimes the development is more exploratory tahn anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad).
    <ul>
      <li>Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-is-a-program-developed-1">How is a program developed?</h4>
<p>Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Investigation is an important step in the process.</li>
  <li>Developers must:
    <ul>
      <li>determine the requirements of the program</li>
      <li>understand the constraints</li>
      <li>understand the user concerns and interests</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How do developers investigate?
    <ul>
      <li>surverys</li>
      <li>user testing</li>
      <li>interviews</li>
      <li>direct observations
After initial investigation and reflection,</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Developers design the program by
    <ul>
      <li>brainstorming (draw on ingestigation)</li>
      <li>storyboarding the program</li>
      <li>planning user experience</li>
      <li>laying out the user interface</li>
      <li>organizing into modules</li>
      <li>develop a testing strategy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Developers decide on the program requirements that
    <ul>
      <li>describe how a program should behave</li>
      <li>include a list of user interactions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The programs specifications outline all of the requirements.</li>
  <li>Developers create a prototype of the program (or components):
    <ul>
      <li>an incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program
Testing, testing, and more testing!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Developers test the program every step of the way.</li>
  <li>Testing occurs at the
    <ul>
      <li>micro level</li>
      <li>macro level</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="learning-objectives-1">Learning Objectives</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Acknowledge code segments used from other sources.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="essential-knowledge-1">Essential Knowledge</h4>
<ul>
  <li>It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source.</li>
  <li>Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the origin or original author’s name.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-is-aprogram-developed">How is aprogram developed?</h4>
<p>Program development is rarely a solo endeavor.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Programs are usually developed by teams of peoplle.</li>
  <li>Individuals/teams work on different functional components.</li>
  <li>Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work.</li>
  <li>Their names must e written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project.
While documentation is an important place to give credit:</li>
  <li>Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit.</li>
  <li>This is an important part of the development of the program.</li>
  <li>When developers find a bug (or an error in a program), they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem.</li>
  <li>This may be most useful after program is completed, and users find additional bugs.
Many times developers use code segments, procedures, alogrithms, and and more that are written by others.</li>
  <li>These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited.</li>
  <li>This is similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article.</li>
  <li>Any code segments, procedures, algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author.</li>
  <li>The program documentation should influde the author’s name and the source of any code segments being used.</li>
  <li>This portion of the documentaion may resemble a bibliography or a works cited page in a research paper.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="daily-video-3">Daily Video 3</h2>

<h4 id="lesson-objectives">Lesson Objectives</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="essential-knowledge-2">Essential Knowledge</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed.</li>
  <li>Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs.</li>
  <li>Programmers should document a program throughout its development.</li>
  <li>Program documentation helps in developing and maintaininig correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments.</li>
  <li>Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be rquired.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-is-a-program-developed-2">How is a program developed?</h4>
<p>Programmers create something called program documentation in order to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>describe the overall program</li>
  <li>list program specifications</li>
  <li>describe:
    <ul>
      <li>functions/procedures/methods within the code</li>
      <li>specific code segments</li>
      <li>list of events and corresponding outputs</li>
      <li>the development of the program</li>
      <li>how other programs may interact with the program</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>list of contributors/authors of the program</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="when-does-documentation-happen">When does documentation happen?</h4>
<p>Documentation happens throughout the development of the program:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At the beginning: list of specifications</li>
  <li>During: to keep track of process</li>
  <li>After: to explain the overall process
Documentation throught can improve:</li>
  <li>efficiency of overall programming process</li>
  <li>programmers’ ability to test and refine the program</li>
  <li>programmers’ response to bugs</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-do-programmers-document-while-programming">How do programmers document while programming?</h4>
<p>Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Commenting allows programmers to write text within the program.</li>
  <li>This text does not affect the program.</li>
  <li>Comments are for programmers to read.</li>
  <li>This is a form of ocumentation and can be very useful when programmers collaborate or work individually.</li>
</ul>
