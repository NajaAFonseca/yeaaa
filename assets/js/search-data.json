            "content": "Quiz Corrections . Problem 1 . . I got this wrong because the code segment necer changes second. The correct answer is B because the code segment assigns the initial value of first to temp, then assigns the initial value of second to first. The initial value of first, which has been stored in temp, is then assigned to second. Therefore, the initial values of first and second have been interchanged. . Problem 14 . . I got this wrong because the programs display different values. The correct answer was C because The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the corresponding value from program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11. . Problem 31 . . I got this wrong because both programs correctly move the robot to the gray square. The correct answer is C because program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the upper-left corner of the grid. . Problem 35 . . I got this wrong because using samples from nondigital sound sources could put the musician at risk of violating copyright laws. The correct answer is D because Creative Commons licenses can be used by creators of digital music to specify how the samples can be used by others. A no-rights-reserved license allows others to freely make use of the samples. Also, I misclicked :)! . Problem 44 . . I got this wrong because the operation 10 plus 7 causes an overflow error, but 12 plus 3 does not produce a result large enough to cause an overflow error.. The correct answer is B because With a 4-bit integer representation, 2 to the fourth power values can be represented, which allows for the values between 0 to 15, inclusive. If an operation results in a value greater than 15, an overflow error will occur. Of the operations given in the options, only 10 plus 7 gives a result larger than 15. .",

            "content": "Notes . Key Components to How a Computer Works . RAM, CPU, + Alternate Storage Devices . What is RAM? . Random Access Memory (RAM)! . It is a type of computer memory that provides temporary storage for data and instructions that the computer is currently using. When a program or application is opened on a computer, it is loaded into the RAM. The RAM is then used by the computer’s CPU (Central Processing Unit) to store and manipulate data and instructions quickly. This is because accessing data from RAM is much faster than accessing it from the computer’s hard drive. . RAM is volatile memory, meaning that it loses its contents when the computer is turned off or restarted. This is why the computer needs to load the operating system and other programs into RAM each time it is turned on. . Note: the amount of RAM on a computer affects its performance, more RAM = better computer . What is CPU? . Central Processing Unit (CPU)! . The primary component in a computer that performs most of the processing tasks. The CPU is a microprocessor chip that is located on the computer’s motherboard. It communicates with other components in the computer system such as RAM, hard drives, and input/output devices. . The CPU carries out the instructions provided by software programs, performing arithmetic and logic operations, as well as managing input and output operations. The CPU also controls the clock speed, which is the rate at which it processes instructions The performance of a computer is often measured in terms of the speed and power of the CPU. . Note: faster CPUs with more cores and higher clock speeds can execute instructions more quickly and handle more complex tasks. Modern CPUs can perform billions of calculations per second, making them incredibly powerful and essential components of modern computing. It is often referred to as the “brain” of the computer because it is responsible for executing instructions and managing the operations of the computer. . Alternate Storage Devices . Hard Disk Drive (HDD): An HDD is a type of non-volatile storage device that uses magnetic disks to store data. It is commonly used to store the operating system, applications, and user data. . | Solid-State Drive (SSD): An SSD is a type of non-volatile storage device that uses flash memory to store data. It is faster and more reliable than an HDD and is commonly used as the primary storage device in modern computers. . | Optical Disc Drive (ODD): An ODD is a type of storage device that uses optical discs (such as CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs) to store data. It is commonly used to install software, play movies, and store backups. . | USB Flash Drive: A USB flash drive is a type of portable non-volatile storage device that uses flash memory to store data. It is commonly used to transfer data between computers or to store backups. . | Memory Card: A memory card is a type of portable non-volatile storage device that is commonly used in digital cameras, smartphones, and other portable devices to store data such as photos and videos. . | Cloud Storage: Cloud storage is a type of online storage that allows users to store and access their data over the internet. It is commonly used for backup and file-sharing purposes. . | . Notes + Definitions . Listing Specifications of your Computer, or Computers if working as Pair/Trio . Processor GHz: GHz (gigahertz) is a unit of frequency that is commonly used to measure the clock speed of a computer CPU. It represents the number of clock cycles that the CPU can perform in one second, and it is often used as an indicator of the CPU’s processing power. | Memory in GB (Gigabytes): the amount of RAM (Random Access Memory) that a computer has. | Storage in GB: the amount of non-volatile storage capacity that a computer has. | OS (Operating System): a software program that manages and controls the basic functions of a computer system. It acts as an interface between the computer hardware and the user, providing a way for users to interact with the computer and run applications. | . Definitions . Input devices: computer hardware components that allow users to input data, commands, and instructions into a computer system. These devices enable users to communicate with the computer and interact with applications, software programs, and operating systems. Examples: keyboards, mouse, touchpad, touchscreen, scanner, microphone, joystick/controller, gamepads, digital cameras, barcode readers, etc. | Output devices: computer hardware components that display or output data and information from a computer system. These devices allow users to receive feedback, view results, and interact with applications, software programs, and operating systems. Examples: monitor, printer, speaker, headphones, projector, etc. | Program File: program files are files that contain the instructions and data necessary for a computer program or software application to run. These files are usually stored in specific directories or folders on the computer’s file system, and they may include additional resources such as images, icons, and other media. Examples: hard drive, SSD, etc. | Program Code: refers to the set of instructions and commands that are used to create software programs and applications. Program code is typically created by software developers, who write the code using a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE). The code is then compiled or interpreted by a software tool into a form that can be executed by a computer’s processor. This code is typically written in C++, Java, Python, or JavaScript. | Processes: a process refers to a program or task that is currently executing on a computer’s operating system. A process is a fundamental concept in operating system design and management, and it plays a critical role in determining the performance and functionality of a computer system. Each process is assigned a unique process identifier (PID) by the operating system, which is used to identify and manage the process. Processes can run in the background or foreground of the operating system, and they can perform a wide range of tasks, such as executing software programs, managing system resources, or responding to user input. | Ports: a communication endpoint used in networking to identify a specific process or application running on a computer. Ports allow different programs and services on a computer to send and receive data over a network connection.Each port is assigned a unique number, known as a port number, which is used to identify the specific process or service that is listening on that port. Port numbers range from 0 to 65535, with certain ranges reserved for specific purposes. | Data File: a file that contains information or data that can be read or processed by a computer program. Data files can take many different forms, depending on the type of data they contain and the format in which the data is stored. Examples: text, image, spreadsheet, audio/video, database, etc. | Inspect Running Code: the process of examining the execution of a computer program while it is running. There are several tools and techniques that can be used to inspect running code, depending on the programming language, operating system, and development environment being used. This can be done for a variety of purposes, such as debugging, performance tuning, or understanding how a program works. | Inspect Variables: the process of examining the values of variables at different points during the execution of a program. Variables are used in programming to store and manipulate data, and their values can change as a program runs. Utilized by the same examples as before. | . 4.1 Video Notes + Vocabulary . 4.1 Daily Video 1 + Vocab . Learning Objective . ☆ Explain how computing devices work together in a network. .

Learning Objective . Essential Knowledge . The internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open (nonproprierary) communication protocols. | Access to the internet depends on the ability to connect a computing device to an internet connected device. | A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system. | The protocols used in the internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the internet. | Routing on the internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance | The scalability of a system is the capacity for the system to change in size and scale to meet new demands. | The internet was designed to be scalable | Information is passed through the internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets. | Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the internet, as well as for data reassembly. | Packets may arrive at the destination in order, out of order, or not at all | IP, TCP and UDP are common protocols used on the internet. | The world wide web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files. | HTTP is a protocol used by the world wide web | The world wide web uses the internet | . Notes . Drawn Diagram . 4.2 Notes . 4.2 Daily Video 1 Notes . Lesson Objective . Fault-Tolerant Systems: . Describe the benefits of fault tolerance | Identify the vulnerabilities to failure in a system | . Essential Knowledge . The internet has been enginered to be fault-tolerant, with abstractions for routing and transmitting data | Redundancy is the inclusion of extra components that can be used to mitigate failure of a system if other components fail | One way to accomplish network redundancy is by having more than one path between any connected device | If a particular device or connection on the Internet fails, subsequent data will be sent via a different route, if possible | Fault-tolerant is when a system can continue to support failures and still function | Redundancy within a system often requires additional resources but can provide the benefit of fault tolerance | The redundancy of routing options between two points increases the realiability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people | . Notes/Network Activity . Network Paths: . Some networks paths are linked through others in a sequential order. While other network paths are linked through many different connections from different paths. The benefit of them being linked this way is that a network will still have access to another network if one network path has an error. . 4.2 Daily Video 2 Notes . Leson Objectives . Fault-Tolerant System: . Explain how a given system is fault tolerant | . Essential Knowledge . The Internet has been engineered to be fault-tolerant, with abstractions for routing and transmitting data | Redundancy is the inclusion of extra components that can be used to mitigate failure of a system if other components fail | One way to accomplish network redundancy is by having more than one path between any connected devices | If a particular device or connection on the internet fails, subsequent data will be sent via different route, if possible | When a system can support failures and still continue to function, it is called fault-tolerant. This is important because elements of complex systems fail at unexpected times, often in groups, + fault tolerance allows users to continue to use the network. | | . Summarized Understanding of Fault Tolerance . I used chatgpt: . Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system or component to continue functioning in the event of a failure or fault. This can be achieved through various techniques such as redundancy, error detection and correction, and graceful degradation. The goal of fault tolerance is to ensure that the system remains operational even if one or more components fail, thereby minimizing downtime, data loss, and other negative consequences. Fault tolerance is an important consideration in the design of critical systems such as aircraft, medical equipment, and financial trading systems, as well as in computer systems and networks. . My Understanding: . Fault-tolerance helps networks because it is able to continue making connections via other networks despite some path failures. Basically, it’s a life lesson about preserving but sometimes it also doesn’t work because less connection paths means path failures can lead to overall disconnection of some networks. .",

A dictionary, on the other hand, is used to store a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a corresponding value. . | Indexing: Lists are indexed by integers starting from 0, which means you can access elements in a list using their position. Dictionaries are indexed by their keys, which means you can access elements in a dictionary using their key values. . | Order: Lists maintain the order of their elements, which means the first element you add will be the first element in the list. Dictionaries, on the other hand, do not maintain any particular order of their key-value pairs. . | Mutability: Lists are mutable, which means you can add, remove, or modify elements in a list. Dictionaries are also mutable, which means you can add, remove, or modify key-value pairs in a dictionary. . | Duplicate keys: Dictionaries cannot have duplicate keys, but lists can have duplicate elements. . | Memory usage: Dictionaries generally use more memory than lists, especially if they have a large number of key-value pairs. . | In summary, lists are useful for storing ordered collections of items, while dictionaries are useful for storing key-value mappings.

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a ___. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is ___. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # the output only prints 1, 2, and 3, it does not repeat the other numbers in the set # therefore only printing out the unique value # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # I think sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables because there can only be one unique value. # there are also no duplicates in Hashmaps/Hashtables . {1, 2, 3} .

Sequential Processing . The for loop iterates over the list of images and processes them one at a time, in order. . Sequential - going through a sequence. . Parallel Computing . In parallel or concurrent mode, the ThreadPoolExecutor is used to submit each image to a separate worker thread, allowing multiple images to be processed simultaneously. Multithreading allows multiple concurrent tasks of a process at the same time. The executor.map() method is used to apply the process_image function to each image in the images list. .

Essential Knowledge: . Sequential computing is a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at atime | Parallel computing is a computational model where the program is broken into multiple smaller sequential computing operations, some of which are performed simultaneously | Distributed computing is a computational model in which multiple devices are used to run a program | Comparing efficiency of solutions can be done by comparing the time it takes them to perform the same task | A sequential solution takes as long as the sum of all of its steps | A parallel compution solution takes as long as its sequential tasks plus the longest of its parallel tasks | The &quot;speedup&quot; of a parallel solution is measured in the time it took to complete the task sequentially divided by the time it took to complete the task when done in parallel | Parallel computing consists of a parallel portion and a sequential portion | Solutions that use parallel computing can scale more effectively than solutions that use sequential computing Distributed computing allows problems to be solved that could not be solved on a single computer because of either the processing time or the storage needs involved | Distributed computing allows much larger problems to be solved quicker than they could be solved using a single computer | When increasing the use of parallel computing in a solution, the efficiency of the solution is still limited by the sequential portion. This means that at some point, adding parallel portions will no longer meaningfully increase efficiency | . Sequential, Parallel and Distributed Computing . Computer Tasks . A computer needs to handle many tasks as it operates: . System Tasks: the operating system has dozens of tasks, like scheduling what it will be doing next, managing hardware, working with the network, etc. . | User Tasks: executing programs that the user has selected, such as running MS Excel and MS Word, or computer games . | . | Tasks need to be scheduled by the operating system. Balance tasks so all CPUs are being used evenly and fully. . | . ☆ Running tasks can be done sequentially, in parallel, and be distributed to other computers. . Sequential Computing . Sequential Computing. Tasks are done one after another, in a sequence. It is a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at a time. . The computer works tasks A, B, C, ... one at a time. Why does a computer use sequential computing to run one task at a time . - **Limited hardware:** It only has one CPU (older hardware). - **Tasks are dependent:** Task B depends on Task A, Task C depends on Task B, so the needed order is A, B, and then C. . Execution Time: Sequential Operations add up all the individual task execution times. . Example: . Task A takes 50ms | Task B takes 40 ms | Task C takes 35 ms | Total processing time is 50ms + 40ms + 35ms = 125 ms | . Think of Sequential Computing as items one at a time on a conveyor belt. . Parallel Computing Pt. 1 . Why Parallel: . Hardware driven: New hardware has several processors in one system, called cores. 1 CPU can have 64+ cores. Graphics cards for gaming can have thousands of cores. . | Faster Operations: Supercomputers link hundreds of CPUs together to work the same problem. . | Data Driven: A lot of data can be processed the same way (video gaming), called SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) . | Solutions that use parallel computing can scale more effectively than solutions that use sequential computing . | . | . Parallel Computing Pt. 2 . Execution Time: Time equals the longest time taken on any given processor. | A parallel computing solution takes as long as its sequential tasks plus the longest of its parallel tasks. | Parallel processing works best when the tasks are independent from each other--they don&#39;t depend on each other&#39;s answers. | . | . Example: . Core 1: Task A takes 45ms | Core 2: Task B takes 50 ms | Core 3: Task C takes 25 ms; task D takes 30ms | Core 4: Task E takes 40 ms | . Total time needed: 55ms (Core 3 with tasks C and D in sequence) . --&gt; Total time is 55ms because that&#39;s the longest task, the others will run in parallel but take all Tasks will be done by 55ms . Comparing Efficiency of Solutions . Comparing effieciency of solutions can be done by comparing the time it takes them to perform the same task. . Sequential: . ☆ Adding up all the individual tasks for execution time. . Core 1: Task A takes 50ms | Core 2: Task B takes 40ms | Core 3: Task C takes 35ms | . Total processing time is 50ms + 40ms + 35ms = 125ms . Parallel: . ☆ Time is the longest time taken on any given processor . Core 1: Task A takes 50ms | Core 2: Task B takes 40ms + task C takes 35ms | . Total time needed: 75ms (Core 2 w/ tasks B and C in sequence) . Speed Up Time . The &quot;speedup&quot; of a parallel solution is measured in the time it took to complete the task sequentially divided by the time it took to complete the task when done in parallel. . Sequential Total processing time is 50ms + 40ms + 35ms = 125ms Parallel total time needed = 75ms | Speedup - 125ms / 75ms equals about 1.67ms | . | . NOTE: When increasing the use of parallel computing in a solution, the efficiency of the solution is still restricted by the sequential portion. This means that at some point, adding parallel portions will no longer significantly increase efficiency. . Distributed Computing . ☆ Distributed Computing is the sending of tasks from one computer to one or more others. It is a model in which multiple devices are used to run a program. . ☆ Distributed Computing can mix sequential and parallel computing, based on how it sends out tasks to other computers to work. . ☆ Distributed Computing allows problems to be solved that could not be solved on a single computer because of either the processing time or storage needs to be involved. . Examples: Google Web Search: you ask for a search, and Google sends the request to its thousands of servers in the background. | Web Services: standards on how computers can ask for task execution over the web. This includes protocals like SOAP, RSS, REST, etc. | Beowolf Clusters: special software to group different computers together. | . | . How is Distrubuted Computing different from Parallel + Sequential? . Uses more than one physical computer | The computers, data, and tasks can be very different from each other | Needs a network | Is a mix of sequential and parallel execution of tasks | Can take longer based on the network and waiting for responses from other computers | . Recap . A computer needs to handle many tasks as it operates | Tasks need to be scheduled by the operating system and balance tasks so all CPUs are being used evenly and fully | Parallel computing schedule tasks to be executed at the same time | Sequential Computing is a computational model in which oiperations are performed in order one at a time | Distributed Computing is the sending of tasks from one computer to one or more others. It is a model in which multiple devices are used to run a program | Parallel computing consists of a parallel portion and a sequential portion | . Examples . Example 1 . A particular computer has two identical processors which can run in paralle. Each process must be executed on a single processor and each processor can only run one process at a time. . The table below lists the amount of time it takes to execute each of the processes on a single computer. None of the processes are dependent on any of the others. . Process Execution Time . X | 50 seconds | . Y | 10 seconds | . Z | 30 seconds | . What is the minnimum amount of time (approxmate) to execute all three processes when the two processors are run in parallel? . 50 seconds, because if you run process Y and Z in parallel the longest amount of time will still be X because it takes the lonest. . Example 2 . A computer has two duplicate processors that are able to run in parallel. The table below shows the amount of time it takes each processer to execute eachg of two processes. Neither process is dependent on the other. . Process Execution Time . A | 25 seconds | . B | 45 seconds | . What is the difference in execution time between running the two processes in parallel in place of running them one after the other on a single processor? . First, calculate the time run in parallel: 45 seconds. Next, calculate the time run in sequence: 45 + 25 = 70 seconds. Now subtract to find the difference: 70 - 45 = 25 secfond difference from running the two processors in parallel and in sequence. . Example 3 . A computer has two processors that can run in parallel. The table below indicates the amount of time it takes each processor to execute four different processes. None of the processes is dependent on any of the other processes. . Process Execution Time . A | 25 seconds | . B | 25 seconds | . C | 10 seconds | . D | 40 seconds | . Describe how the program should assign the four processes to optimize executrion time? . The four programs should run in parallel of A + B and C + D so the total execution time can be a minnimum of 50 seconds. . Hacks - Build List Comprehension .

Question 1: A researcher is analyzing data about students in a school district to determine whether there is a relationship between grade point average and number of absences. The researcher plans on compiling data from several sources to create a record for each student. . The researcher has access to a database with the following information about each student. . Last name | First name | Grade level (9, 10, 11, or 12) | Grade point average (on a 0.0 to 4.0 scale) | The researcher also has access to another database with the following information about each student. . | First name | Last name | Number of absences from school | Number of late arrivals to school | . Upon compiling the data, the researcher identifies a problem due to the fact that neither data source uses a unique ID number for each student. Which of the following best describes the problem caused by the lack of unique ID numbers? . Students who have the same name may be confused with each other. . | Students who have the same grade point average may be confused with each other. . | Students who have the same grade level may be confused with each other. . | Students who have the same number of absences may be confused with each other. . | My Answer: . 1, because it is possible that students have the same first name and last name. . Correct Answer: . Question 2: A team of researchers wants to create a program to analyze the amount of pollution reported in roughly 3,000 counties across the United States. The program is intended to combine county data sets and then process the data. Which of the following is most likely to be a challenge in creating the program? . A computer program cannot combine data from different files. . | Different counties may organize data in different ways. . | The number of counties is too large for the program to process. . | The total number of rows of data is too large for the program to process. . | My Answer: . 2, because within data sets there are problems with cleaning data and making it accurate. . Correct Answer: . . Question 3: A student is creating a Web site that is intended to display information about a city based on a city name that a user enters in a text field. Which of the following are likely to be challenges associated with processing city names that users might provide as input? . Select two answers. . Users might attempt to use the Web site to search for multiple cities. . | Users might enter abbreviations for the names of cities. . | Users might misspell the name of the city. . | Users might be slow at typing a city name in the text field. . | My Answer: . 2 and 3 because they seem the most reasonable when it comes to challenges, Cities like LA is an abbrievation for Los Angeles. And misspelling is a common human error. . Correct Answer: . Already Correct! . Question 4: A database of information about shows at a concert venue contains the following information. . Name of artist performing at the show | Date of show | Total dollar amount of all tickets sold | . Which of the following additional pieces of information would be most useful in determining the artist with the greatest attendance during a particular month? . Average ticket price . | Length of the show in minutes . | Start time of the show . | Total dollar amount of food and drinks sold during the show . | My Answer: . It could be 1 or 4 because normally more expensive tickets mean a better/popularer artist, but that is a Bias so I’m going to choose 4. . Correct Answer: . 1, The total dollar amount of food and drinks sold during a show may be correlated with the attendance at the show, but cannot be used to determine the exact number of attendees. . Question 5: A camera mounted on the dashboard of a car captures an image of the view from the driver’s seat every second. Each image is stored as data. Along with each image, the camera also captures and stores the car’s speed, the date and time, and the car’s GPS location as metadata. Which of the following can best be determined using only the data and none of the metadata? . The average number of hours per day that the car is in use . | The car’s average speed on a particular day . | The distance the car traveled on a particular day . | The number of bicycles the car passed on a particular day . | My Answer: . 2, I used the process of elimination, it could be one but im thinking it’s 2 more because the speed is one of the more important pieces of data. Distance can’t be captured because we are only using data and not metadata. And the number of biciycles seems kind of random. . Correct Answer: . 4, The calculation of average speed would be based on speed and time, which are part of the metadata. . Question 6: A teacher sends students an anonymous survey in order to learn more about the students’ work habits. The survey contains the following questions. . On average, how long does homework take you each night (in minutes) ? | On average, how long do you study for each test (in minutes) ? | Do you enjoy the subject material of this class (yes or no) ? | . Which of the following questions about the students who responded to the survey can the teacher answer by analyzing the survey results? . I. Do students who enjoy the subject material tend to spend more time on homework each night than the other students do? II. Do students who spend more time on homework each night tend to spend less time studying for tests than the other students do? III. Do students who spend more time studying for tests tend to earn higher grades in the class than the other students do? . I only | III only | I and II | I and III | My Answer: . 3, because both correlate to the questions the teacher asked. . Correct Answer: . Already Correct!! .",

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . A programmer should care about space and time complexity because it allows for more efficient code. The amount of space complexity also takes up room so excessive use of memory can slow down a program, especially when dealing with large data sets. By optimizing the time complexity of their algorithms, programmers can reduce the time it takes for the program to execute, which can improve user experience and make the program more scalable. Taking in mind of these two things makes for better performance, improved user experience, and more efficient use of hardware resources. | .

Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . I think that this is a space complexity problem because when you run the code with more space complexity, the time takes longer. | . Correct Answer:- both because the bigger the space complexity, the longer time time takes, they both affect each other. . Big O Notation .

Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b; print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . 178 1.78 . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 424 425 426 427 428 429 430 431 432 433 434 435 436 437 438 439 440 441 442 443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 568 569 570 571 572 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 608 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 643 644 645 646 647 648 649 650 651 652 653 654 655 656 657 658 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 678 679 680 681 682 683 684 685 686 687 688 689 690 691 692 693 694 695 696 697 698 699 700 701 702 703 704 705 706 707 708 709 710 711 712 713 714 715 716 717 718 719 720 721 722 723 724 725 726 727 728 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830 831 832 833 834 835 836 837 838 839 840 841 842 843 844 845 846 847 848 849 850 851 852 853 854 855 856 857 858 859 860 861 862 863 864 865 866 867 868 869 870 871 872 873 874 875 876 877 878 879 880 881 882 883 884 885 886 887 888 889 890 891 892 893 894 895 896 897 898 899 900 901 902 903 904 905 906 907 908 909 910 911 912 913 914 915 916 917 918 919 920 921 922 923 924 925 926 927 928 929 930 931 932 933 934 935 936 937 938 939 940 941 942 943 944 945 946 947 948 949 950 951 952 953 954 955 956 957 958 959 960 961 962 963 964 965 966 967 968 969 970 971 972 973 974 975 976 977 978 979 980 981 982 983 984 985 986 987 988 989 990 991 992 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) .

Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . numbers = list(range(1000)) #Iterates through the list twice creating a nested loop

Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) print(fibonacci(20)) #print(fibonacci(30)) # print(fibonacci(40)) . 6765 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3, 4, 5, 6])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) .

ChatGPT Reccomendation + Facts . Both object-oriented programming and imperative programming have their own advantages and disadvantages, and which one is &quot;better&quot; depends on the specific needs of the project and the personal preferences of the programmer. . Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on describing how a program should perform a certain task through a series of statements or instructions. This approach is typically more procedural and involves managing state and data directly. Imperative programming is often used in low-level programming, such as system programming, because it provides more control over the computer&#39;s hardware. . Object-oriented programming, on the other hand, is a programming paradigm that focuses on representing entities or objects in the real world as objects in the code. This approach is more declarative and involves defining classes and objects that interact with each other through methods and properties. Object-oriented programming is often used in higher-level programming, such as application programming, because it provides a more modular and organized approach to programming. . In general, object-oriented programming tends to be more maintainable and scalable, as it allows for the creation of reusable code and more easily understandable program structure. Imperative programming can be more efficient and low-level, making it more suitable for certain types of applications, such as those that require direct control over hardware resources. . Ultimately, the choice between object-oriented programming and imperative programming depends on the specific project requirements and the programmer&#39;s personal preference and expertise. . SQL Insert VS User Init . What is SQL Insert? . it is used to insert new records/rows into a datase table | INSERT statement specifies the values to be inserted into specific columns of the table | . What is User Init? . user init is short for user initialization | initialization is the process of preparing or setting something up for use | . So are they the same? No, because SQL insert is used for new records/rows adding into a database table and it specifies which data is to be added into specific colums of the table. User init is used for configuring user-specified settings or preferences for the user. . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? | Explain try/except, when would except occur? | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? | . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ?

Note . What does the hacked part do? . The hacked part of the code types the message telling the user they&#39;ve been hacked if their password is less than 2 characters. This is to prevent users from updating their password to weak passwords. . Explain try/except, when would except occur? . Except will occur when you want to select certain rows from a table/database. It is used to take two SELECT statements and returns only the distinct rows of the first SELECT statement. . What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? . The code that seems to be repeated in each of these examples are: . cursor.close() | conn.close() | . I think closing the connection is important because you make sure that the code was able to close itself gracefully and to prevent any other objects from reusing the same connection after you are done with it. I think closing the cursor is important because it resets all results, and ensures that the cursor object has no reference to its original connection object. . Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? | In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? | . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() delete() . Note . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? . Yes, SQL delete can be dangerous if not used properly. The DELETE statement in SQL is used to remove rows from a table, and it can be very powerful if used incorrectly. . If you accidentally delete the wrong rows or forget to include a WHERE clause in your DELETE statement, you could potentially delete all the rows in a table, which could have serious consequences for your application or database. . It&#39;s important to always double-check your DELETE statements and make sure you&#39;re deleting the correct rows. You should also make sure you have a backup of your data before performing any significant deletions, just in case something goes wrong. . In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? . &quot;f&quot; is used to create an f-string in Python. An f-string is a string literal that allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, using {} brackets. The expressions inside the {} brackets are evaluated at runtime, and their values are inserted into the string. . In the given statement, the {} brackets contain an expression {uid}, which will be evaluated at runtime to the value of the variable uid. The &quot;f&quot; at the beginning of the string tells Python to format the string using this expression. . So, when the print statement is executed, the value of the expression {uid} will be inserted into the string at the position of the {} brackets, resulting in a string that says &quot;The row with uid {value of uid} was successfully deleted&quot;. . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? | Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? | . def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif operation.lower() == &#39;s&#39;: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . Note . Why does the menu repeat? . The menu repeats because of the recursion call at the end of the menu() function. When a user selects an operation, the corresponding function is executed (e.g., create(), read(), etc.). After the operation is completed, the menu() function is called again, which displays the menu and prompts the user to enter another operation. . This recursion will continue until the user enters an empty string, which serves as the escape key to exit the menu. However, if an exception occurs during the execution of the menu or any of the other functions, the except block will be executed, which will print a message asking the user to perform a Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; before starting the menu. . Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? . Yes, you can! . Chat GPT&#39;s refactored solution: . Menu, to run other cells from one control point . def menu(): operations = [ (&#39;c&#39;, &#39;Create&#39;, create), (&#39;r&#39;, &#39;Read&#39;, read), (&#39;u&#39;, &#39;Update&#39;, update), (&#39;d&#39;, &#39;Delete&#39;, delete), (&#39;s&#39;, &#39;Schema&#39;, schema) ] . while True: # Display menu options print(&quot;Menu:&quot;) for op in operations: print(f&quot;({op[0]}) {op[1]}&quot;) print(&quot;(q) Quit&quot;) # Prompt user for operation selection operation = input(&quot;Enter an operation: &quot;).lower() if operation == &#39;q&#39;: # Exit condition break # Find the operation function based on user&#39;s selection found = False for op in operations: if operation == op[0]: found = True op[2]() # Execute operation function break # If operation not found, print error message if not found: print(&quot;Invalid operation.

Complement this with Debugging example. | Use Imperative or OOP style to Create a new Table or do something that applies to your CPT project. | . | . Reference... sqlite documentation . Do you see procedural/data abstraction . Yes, procedural abstraction in this code could be modeled as the delete() function because it deletes a row from Users, takes care of connecting to the database, creating a cursor object, executing the SQL command to delete the row, and handling any errors that may occur. . For data abstraction, an example from the code above is the sqlite3.connect(databse), this is data abstraction because this connection object abstracts away the details of how the code interacts with the database, such as opening and closing the database file, managing transactions, and handling low-level networking protocols. Instead, the code can simply use the connection object to execute SQL commands and retrieve data from the database. . Definitions . Procedural Abstraction: . Procedural abstraction is a programming concept that involves breaking down a program into smaller, more manageable pieces of code. This is done by dividing the code into smaller functions or procedures that can be called from other parts of the program. | . Data Abstraction: . Data abstraction is a technique in programming that involves hiding the implementation details of data structures and operations, and presenting a simplified and higher-level view of the data to the user. | .",

Note . classs User: What&#39;s the purpose? . The purpose of the class User is to provide a model for managing actions in the &#39;users&#39; table of a database using SQLAlchemy Object Relational Mapping. The class defines the schema for the &#39;users&#39; table and has methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on the table. The class represents the data that we want to store in the &#39;users&#39; table, and it is built on top of the db.Model layer, which is an inner layer of the SQLAlchemy ORM. The User class has instance variables such as id, name, uid, password, and dob that represent the columns in the &#39;users&#39; table. It also has methods to get and set the values of these variables, as well as methods to verify and update passwords. The class provides methods for creating a new record in the &#39;users&#39; table, reading an existing record from the table, updating an existing record, and deleting a record from the table. Additionally, the class has methods to convert the object to a human-readable string and to a dictionary that can be used for an API response. . db.model inheritance . In this code, User class inherits from db.Model class, which means that User class is a subclass of db.Model class. . db.Model is a base class provided by the SQLAlchemy ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library. It provides a set of common functionality to be used by classes that are mapped to database tables. When a class inherits from db.Model, it gains the ability to interact with the database through the SQLAlchemy ORM, such as the ability to define . init method: What is it? . The init method is the constructor method for the User class. It is called when a new User object is created and initializes the object&#39;s instance variables (_name, _uid, _password, and _dob) with the provided arguments (or default values if none are provided). It also calls the set_password method to hash the provided password. . What does property and setter do? . @property is a decorator that defines a method as a &quot;getter&quot; for a class attribute, which allows the attribute to be accessed like a regular attribute but with some additional functionality. When a @property method is called, it returns the value of the attribute it is associated with. | In Python, setters are created using the @.setter decorator. When a setter method is called, it updates the value of the attribute it is associated with.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Additional methods? . . &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Initial Data .

Note . What is the User.query.filter_by? . My Answer . User.query.filter_by() is a method provided by the SQLAlchemy library, which is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It is used to query the database and extract records from a specific table. . ChatGPT Elaborated . In the given code, User.query.filter_by(_uid=uid) is used to extract a single user from the database table User, where _uid matches the provided uid. The filter_by() method filters the records of a table based on the given conditions, and first() method returns the first record from the filtered result set. . So, user variable will hold the record of the User table whose _uid field matches the uid parameter provided to the function. If there is no matching record, None will be returned. . What is the user.password? . user.password refers to an attribute of the User class that stores the user&#39;s password in a hashed format. The is_password() method is then used to verify if the password entered by the user matches the hashed password stored in the database. . Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db .

Note . user=User(...) . ChatGPT . In the given code segment, user = User(name=name, uid=uid, password=password) is used to create a new instance of the User class with the provided values for name, uid, and password. This instance is then assigned to the user variable. . The purpose of this line of code is to create a User object that represents a new user that will be added to the database. By initializing a new instance of the User class with the provided values, we can create a new user with the required information. . Once the User object is created, it is further modified in the subsequent code block by adding the user&#39;s date of birth (dob) to the object. Finally, the object is written to the database using the user.create() method. . Therefore, the purpose of setting user = User(...) is to create a new User object that can be further processed before it is added to the database. . user.dob . Code allows users to input their own date of birth in the order of year, month, to day. If users enter it in incorrectly, the code will input an error so if you tried to enter in a date like 2032 in 2022 the error would occur and set your dob back to default. . user.create() .

Note . User.query.all . User.query.all() retrieves all the users from the database, and the read() function then reads each user&#39;s data and returns it as a list of JSON objects. . json_ready assignment . json_ready is a list of JSON objects, where each JSON object represents a single user&#39;s data from the User table in the database. The list of JSON objects is then returned by the read() function when it is called. . Hacks . Add this Blog to you own Blogging site. In the Blog add notes and observations on each code cell. | Add Update functionality to this blog. | Add Delete functionality to this blog. | . How would I add update functionality to this blog? . I can change the findbyuid from returning none to adding a create() function where you can then update yourself into the user databse. I would have to do this by using an if statement that will run as if user is None: and then put in user input for name, uid, dob, and password. I will also have to add the error checking for dob by using the command used for error checking in the previous code cell. The else portion of the elif statement will be that if the user is in the database, they can update it. You can do this by asking the user if they want to update their user with a yes or no answer and then if no stop running and if they do, the user will be asked what they want to update and then they can pick from name, uid, dob, and password. Once they update it, it will ask if they want to update or exit and so on so forth, it will repeat until the user is satisfied. . Add Delete functionality to this blog? . Like what I was just talking about you can also search for your user like the above and if it&#39;s found it will also ask if you want to delete your user. This can be used through a two factor authentication such as asking &quot;Do you want to delete&quot; then ask &quot;Are you sure&quot; so the user can be 100% sure since we discussed why deleting in SQLAlchemy is dangerous. . &lt;/div&gt; | . | .",

Compare data compression algorithms to determine which is best in a particular context . | Data compression can reduce the size of transmitted or stored data | Fewer bits does not = less info | The amount of size reduction from compression depends on both the amount of redundancy in the original data representation and the compression algorithm applied | Lossless data compression can usually reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted while gauranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data | Lossy data compression algorithms can significally reduce he number of bits stored or transmitted but only allow reconstruction of an approxomation of the original data | Lossy data compression algorithms can usually reduce the number of its stored or transmitted more than lossless compression algorithms | In situations where quality or ability to reconstruct the original is maximally important, lossless compression algorithms are typically chosen | In situations where minimizing data size or transmission time is maximally important, lossy compression algorithms are typically chosen | . What is Data Compression?: . a reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data | used to save transmission time and storage space | . How Does Compression Work? . When data is compressed, you are looking for repeated patterns and predictability | The larger the data file, the more patterns that can be pulled out | . Test Compression . Remove all repeated characters and insert a single character or symbol in its | . Data Compression Methods: Lossless vs Lossy . Lossless: reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted while guaranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data. | Lossy: significicantly reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted but only allow reconstruction of an approxomation of the original data. | . Lossy vs Lossless . Lossless: . The typical approach where the loss of words or numbers would change the information Executable files | Text | Spreadsheet files | . | . Lossy: . The typical approach where the removal of some data has little or no discernible effect on the representation of the content since the data removed are redundant, unimportant or imperceptible Graphics | Audio | Video | Images | . | . Which is Better? . All data compression algorithms have trade offs. Lossy data compression can reduce the data more than lossless but the original data can not be recovered | Lossless data compression lets you restore and recover the original data but it can’t be compressed as much as lossy algorithms | . | Need to recover the original? Choose Lossless! | . | Data size or transmission time is important? Choose Lossy! | . | . Quiz! . Question 1: Which of the following is an advantage of a lossless compression algorithm over a lossy compression algorithm? . A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee that compressed information is kept secure, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot. . | A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee reconstruction of original data, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot. . | A lossless compression algorithm typically allows for faster transmission speeds than does a lossy compression algorithm. . | A lossless compression algorithm typically provides a greater reduction in the number of bits stored or transmitted than does a lossy compression algorithm. . | My Answer: . 2, because while both compress lossless does not extract and remove useless data, it compresses the data and can confirm that all data will be able to be reconstructed. . Correction: . Already Correct!!! . Question 2: A user wants to save a data file on an online storage site. The user wants to reduce the size of the file, if possible, and wants to be able to completely restore the file to its original version. Which of the following actions best supports the user’s needs? . Compressing the file using a lossless compression algorithm before uploading it . | Compressing the file using a lossy compression algorithm before uploading it . | Compressing the file using both lossy and lossless compression algorithms before uploading it . | Uploading the original file without using any compression algorithm . | My Answer: . 1, because if the user wants to reduce the size of the file and wants to be able to completely restore the file to its original version then lossless is the best option. . Correction: . Already Correct!!! . Question 3: A programmer is developing software for a social media platform. The programmer is planning to use compression when users send attachments to other users. Which of the following is a true statement about the use of compression? . Lossless compression of video files will generally save more space than lossy compression of video files. . | Lossless compression of an image file will generally result in a file that is equal in size to the original file. . | Lossy compression of an image file generally provides a greater reduction in transmission time than lossless compression does. . | Sound clips compressed with lossy compression for storage on the platform can be restored to their original quality when they are played. . | My Answer: . 3, because 1 is wrong because lossy compresses more because it’s able to delete data that is not needed, 2 is wrong because compression of a lossless file results in it being smaller than the original, and 4 is wrong because lossy deletes data that is not needed therefore the sound clip would not be restored to its original size. .

The IP address in itself does not contain any extra information about the user. . Question 10 . . I put answer A, the answer was C, I was wrong because public key encryption is widely used because of the functionality it provides in addressing cybersecurity issues when sending information across the Internet. . Question 12 . . I put answer B, the answer was A, I was wrong because emails that request the user to click on an unknown link, as well as requests to share password information, are indicative of a phishing attack. . Question 29 . . I put answer C, the answer was B, I was wrong because the fourth statement assigns the value false to a. The fifth statement assigns the value false to c. . Question 35 . . I put answer D, the answer was A, I was wrong because for example, when scoreB &gt; scoreC &gt; scoreA, the code segment incorrectly identifies Team C as the winner instead of Team B. . Question 36 . . I put answer A, the answer was D, I was wrong because code segment III works correctly. Code segment III assigns “C” when the numeric score is less than 80, or “B” if the numeric score is not less than 80 but is less than or equal to 90, or “A” otherwise. . Question 39 . . I put answer C, the answer was A, I was wrong because inserting this statement between lines 6 and 7 increases the value of count once for each iteration of the outer loop, which results in count being half as large as it should be. . Question 40 . . I put answer C, the answer was D, I was wrong because after moving forward two squares, turning right, and moving forward four squares, if the robot were to turn right, then the next move forward would put the robot into the black region of the grid. . Question 41 . . I put answer A, the answer was B, I was wrong because the values can be stored in any numerical base as long as they are sorted. . Question 49 . . I put answer D, the answer was B, I was wrong because in order to validate the predicted results of a simulation, observed data may be needed for comparison purposes. However, running a simulation does not require observations before it can be used. . Question 50 . . I put answers B + C, the answers were A + D, I was wrong because as the size of the list grows, the number of steps needed to sort the list grows at an exponential rate, as the number of steps is equal to 2^n for a list of size n.

The purpose of this program is so users who want to visit places in San Diego can filter activities that cater more to their liking, making it easier for them to find activities to participate in. . Function: . The functionality of this program is going to be the users ability to select different activities, manage a budget, + preferred duration time of an activity through a dropdown menu. The user would then press “filter or “filter activities” and the activities would proceed to filter based on the selections of the user. . Data Abstraction . Two code segments: . A list that is going to show how data is going to be stored will be the list of activities and places to visit in San Diego when added into our API. The use of this list will be showed when a student presses filter to see certain activities filtered. . Identifies the name of the variable: . I plan on naming the list of activities in my API as activities . Describes the data in the list: . The list will contain data describing the activities because in order for the user to be able to sort through certain activites, each list will have to be asssigned a activity category, budget, and duration time. . Managing Complexity . List used to manage comlpexity: . The list used to manage complexity will be the one that filters activities, budget, + duration time in the drop down menus. . Explain how the list manages complexity: . The list manages comlexity because it will filter activities in the API and without it the code would be unable to filter the activities at all. . Procedural Abstraction . Student-developed procedure: . A student-developed procedure that I’m thinking I could use is one that would run what would happen if a user were to select an activity from the dropdown menus (of activity, budget, or time). When the user selects it, the drop down menu will need to save the students option and the code will need to too. When the code saves all of these the user will be able to filter without the code forgetting their options. The procedure will be called when the user clicks the selected dropdown option. . Functionality: . This procedure contributes to the functionality because when the user selects something from the dropdown menu it will need to be saved in order for the activities to filter, if not the activities may not oiutput at all or all activities will show. . Algorithm Implementation . Student-developed algorithm . The list that will sort through activities will be used to demonstrate sequincing, selection, + iteration. . Testing . In my written response I will identify two calls to the procedure and describe the condition(s) being tested by each call. And I will identify the result of each call. .",

A harmful effect of using computers is you could get your data stolen or you could get hacked. | A harmful effect of using computers is that you could get addicted to video games or sucked into online media | A harmful effect of using computers is you could get groomed by online predators. | Dopamine Issues . Real? . I believe that dopamine is real and that it does cause many issues, especially in those who use social media. Social media sucks in a lot of people to want more and more. Everytime someone gets ading on their phone, they feel that dopamine rush and excitement that they’ve been notified. For example, likes on posts from social media make many people feel happy or appreciated. . Parent Conspiracy? . Not a parent conspiracy, dopamine has been scientifically proven and their are stories such as Anthony Rosner’s that show the effects of dopamine. . Dopamine in My Life . I feel like I got a lot of dopamine from playing video games and watching TikTok, both which affected my school performance. I would spend 2 hours every night playing video games, which is 10 hours a week. I started playing less and less because I realized how unhealthy this habit was and how much it affected me. I eventually stopped gaming completely and have a healthier school/life balance. With TikTok, I would get so sucked in I would watch it for hours and time would fly by in well… no time. I would be watching at 5pm and then it would be 7pm. So, I deleted TikTok to also benefit my school/life balance. From here I developed healthier habits to help me balance school when I needed a break. I started reading in between hours I would do my homework. I would practice drawing or copy sketches in my notebook as well. These things helped me reduce the addiction of Dopamine, and benefit my daily life. . 5.2 Notes . Digital Divide . Digital divide is the divide between to those who can access computers and those who cannot. . Poorer/rural areas in America may not have less or little access to technology | Some countries may have different or restricted access | . Things that contribute to the Digital Divide . older computers or older technology in general may not have access to the latest updates | regional distinction | school blocked sites and restrictions | . Blog Post Reflection . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . People can empower themself in a digital world by being familiar with simple commands that they can use. For example, when a teacher is going too fast on a lesson and I’m able to access the lesson on my computer I can use command shift + 3 to take a quick screenshot of what the teacher is talking about or going over. Another example, in comp sci when I need to record a video I can use command shift + 5 to screen record. . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . Someone who is empowered in knowledge can help someone that is not empowered by helping students who may be less knowledgable then others. Something I could do at DNHS is tutoring students who are in grades below me or taking classes I’ve previously taken. . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . I don’t think paper is blcking digital empowerment, but I think red tape could be. If there are steps that you have to complete before doing something it could be lengthening the digital process and slowing down digital empowerment. At Del Norte, there are restrictions that block . 5.3 Summary . I thought each of the excercises were really fun and I enjoyed talking with my classmates and switching talking partners. I liked the answers to a lot of the questions they were innovative and eye opening. When Colin mentioned that Alexa and Siri may have been female voices because women have been seen as the secretary or help it was an impressive conclusion. I also liked hearing about the difference between age groups of Facebook and TikTok. We discussed algorithms that influence ourdecisions like ads and how they push us things the algorithm thinks we would like so we buy it. I also think HP computers are somewhat wrong (but not racist), because I’m sure that they had to do thorough testing in order to see if the face tracking worked. My conclusion is perhaps they did test it on someone who had darker skintone but did not care to write or say that the face tracking would not work on those of darker skin tones. As it would be well, weird. . 5.4 Hacks . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . A crowdsource idea that would initiate our environment is a quiz or quick question. . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . My project would be better with crowdsourcing because I can ask people what their favorite places are in San Diego County and when they answer I can add those places to the API in my travel project. This would help people go to places that they will like/enjoy. . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make the evening interesting?

Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. | MIT License notes: . can be used to license your code and others can use your code but the license will make sure that the user has to credit the owner of the code. | it uses open source and closed source, open source means everyone have access. closed source says that only people who can access the code can use it. | . In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. . | Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. . | MIT License .

I have seen PII when students link their github to the top of their website which can show who the contributors are. . | What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? I think PII is useful for online things such as LinkedInn and if you’re resume is online and you’re looking for a job. I personally have played video games and think that PII can also be dangerous. There are people who don’t care too much about their PII and will tell you things you shouldn’t probably know about them. Otherwise, I keep my PII private online. . | Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. Good: . contain at least 8 characters | contain more than upper and lowercase words such as numbers and symbols | aren’t repeated from previous passwords | . | Bad: . short like 3 characters | contain only letters | are repeated from previous passwords multiple times | . Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. | Symmetric: a type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic data, probably less secure than asymmetric encryption. . Asymmetric: a process that uses a pair of related keys: one public key and one private key more secure than symmetric encryption. . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. an example that we used was in the PBL model user databse, we used password hashing to encrypt passwords and make them more secure. . | Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. I have never been “phished.” Phishing techniques include scam links and virus/malware. . |",

Every other requirement is met besides this one. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The student shows a list that manages complexity, but does not explain how it manages complexity because they do not explain why the code could not work without this list or could be written differently. | The student meets neither two criteria. List does not manage complexity because they could use an if statement to set the cpuPlay variable to a random number. Written response of why the code manages complexity is incorrect because what they say is just as easy to develop or maintain as the one with lists. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 0 | The student includes a two code segments: one that shows a student developed procedure with at least one parameter and shows where said procedure is being called. The student also describes the functionality of the program. | The student meets first criteria, but not second. The criteria is not met because the response does not specify how the procedure contributes to the overall program. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Written response includes a student-developed algorithm that includes: sequencing, selection, and iteration. And the student explains in enough detail how the identified algorithm works and someone could recreate it using such info. | The student meets the first criteria of an algorithm with: sequencing, selection, and iteration. The second criteria is also met through the students written response. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The student describes two different calls in answer section 3c each passing a different argument that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute. In answers 3d, the student describes two conditions being tested by each call procedure and identifies the result of each and every call. | Student response describes two calls to the procedure with different arguments, leading to different results.

Data Abstraction | 0 | 1 | Written response contains two code segments: one showing how data has been stored in a list and the other showing how the data in the list is being used to fulfill the program purpose. However, does not use name of list being used in reponse and does not describe what the data in the list is representing in the program. | Two distinct code segments, name of list is identified, + response identifies what is stored in the lsit. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | Includes a code segment that is used to manage complexity in the program. And writes about how the code segment would be inefficient without it because of the additional steps it would take to fill in. | Includes a code segment that manages complexity + response explains how the code would be written differently without the list. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The written response includes two code segments: a student-develoepd procedure with at least one parameter + one showing where the student-developed procedure is being called.

Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Two code segments, one shows data being stored in a list, the other does not. Identifies the name of the variable. And response is inaccurate as stateList only contains information following the names of States. | Two distinct code segments are provided, but only the second code segment shows data being stored in the identified list. Name of the list is identified as stateList. Description is inaccurate as the identified list stateList appears to represent only the state name. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | Includes program segment that shows managing comlpexity but written response does not specify a simplified way to write the code or how the code would not work without this code. | The response includes code that uses lists to manage complexity; however, the response does not explain how the specific code cannot be written without a list or would be written in a more complex manner. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Two code segments, lackinga single parameter, and no call is related to the second code segment. Therefore, also inaccurately describing what the identified procedure does and does not answer how it contributes to overall functionality of the program. | The response includes a student-developed procedure, updateScreen, but it does not have any parameter. In addition, the second code segment does not show any call to the procedure updateScreen.

Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | Shows a list being used to manage complexity + explains how the list makes the code more efficient than taking longer, tedious steps to create the same code in a more complex way. | Student response includes code that uses a list of lists to manage complexity. The main list represents fish, where each list element is also a list that stores the type of fish and the number of that type of fish that are caught + response explains how the code can be written without using lists in a plausible manner. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Program segments: one that shows a student-developed procedure with at least one paramater + one showing where said student-developed procedure is being called. Student describes identified procedure and how it contributes to overall functionality. | Response includes a student-developed procedure, clone+movement+range, with five parameters that are used in the procedure + includes a call in the procedure. Student describes the functionality of the procedure + states how the procedure contributes to the overall functionality of the program. | .

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | I gave them a one because they used input, output, and showed program functionality when they tested their code. in their written response, they specifically state the purpose of the code is to provide information about a triangle based on the input side lengths. | College board states that the written response did not meet the criteria because the written response describes the function and not the program purpose. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The data in the program is used from user input when the code finds the angles of each side of the triangle using sin, cosine, and tangent. The variables are listed as the sides of the triangle: A, B, and C. The data from user input is representing the side lengths of the triangle. Their written response contains two completely distinguishable code segments with descriptions on both code segments of what each list does. | College board says that they named their list, provided their two code segments, and had a good written response all which meet College Board criteria. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 0 | The student shows managing complexity because they include a list that organizes their code and sets it up into a nice form. However, I&#39;m not sure if this list really is beneficial to the code although the purpose says to get information on the triangle based on inputted sidelengths and if the list sideIndex is classifying the different types of triangles then I believe it helps manage complexity. | The student deserved a 0 because despite their 4 classifications, the written response was innacurate. As well as, the student states a line that would actually make their code more difficult to manage without a list. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | I gave the student a one because they show both a student-developed procedure and a parameter that shows the functionality of the procedure. Additionally, the student shows where the procedure is being called and throughly describes the procedure as well as describing how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program. | College Board gave this student a one for their student-developed procedure: ratioCalculate, code fragment that class ratioCalculate, the students description of functionality, and because the students states how the procedure contributes to the overall program. | . Algorithm Implentation | 1 | 1 | I gave the student a one because they show sequencing, selection, and iteration in their code. As well as, explaining in detailed steps how the algorithm works enough that someone could recreate it. | College board gave this student a one because they show sequencing, selection, and iteration in their code through the function ratioCalculate. Next, college board also gave the student a one because of the way they described the algorithm functionality enough so it could be recreated. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | I gave the student a one because in 3c the student shows 2 calls to the selected procedure, each different to produce a different segment of code to execute. The student also describes the conditions being called to each procedure, and all in all the student also shows the result of each call in their video. | College board gave the student a one because they describe two different call procedures: ratioCalculate(3.0,4.0,5.0) and ratioCalculate(1.2, 2.3, 3.4). The students response describes the conditions being tested in the procedure calls and identifies the results of each call. | . Submission 2 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments College Board Comments . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video demonstrates user input, program functionality, and output. In the written response, the student discusses the overall purpose of the program, the functionality of the program, and describes both input and output of the program. | The video demonstrates he running of the program: input comes from user placing tiles on the grid, output comes from display of the simulation. And shows user pause, editing, and replaying simulation. Written response specifies program purpose, describes the functionality, and descrines input and output. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Shows how data has been stored in the list and shows how data in the list is being used. Identifies the names of the variables of each list and thoroughly describes the data that is stored in the list. | The written reponse provided two different code segments, one showing data being stored and another showing it being accessed. The name of the list is identified as startGrid, however the other lists are not considered inside the scoring. And the code identifies what is stored in the list. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The written response shows the a list being used to manage complexity and explains how the list manages complexity and writes how the code could not be written without the list. | College Board gave the student a 1 becuase they stated the list manages complexity through accessing and storing the status (1 or 0) f 10,800 items. As well as, explaining how the code couldn&#39;t be written without a list. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student shows a student-develoeped procedure that has one parameter that affects the functionality of the procedure and the student shows where the procedure is being called. The student also describes the identified procedures and describes how it contributes to the overall functionality. | The response contais a student-developed procedure: replaceList. And two parameters: current and replacement. And the student creates a call to the procedure. The response also describes the functionalit of the procedure. | . Algorithm Implentation | 1 | 1 | The student includes a photo of the develoepd algorithm that included sequencing, selection, and iteration. Algorithm is detailed enough that someone could recreate it. | The student had a student-developed algorithm within procedure: replaceList. Which included sequencing, selection, and iteration. And the response explains in detail how he algorithm in the procedure works. Explained thoroughly to the point of it being able to be recreated. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The student describes two calls to the selected procedure that causes a different segment of code to execute with thorough explanation from the student. They also describe the conditions being tested by each call to the procedure. And they identify the result to the call fo each procedure. | Response describes 2 different calls to the specific procedure and describes the condition being tested. And describes the result of the two calls as well as they both lead to 2 different results. | .",

Decidable problems . These are problems for which algorithms can be written to solve/produce a correct output for all possible inputs. They have simple yes or no answers, true or false, even or odd. . Undecidable problems . These are problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer. Cannot be solved with any algorithm. . Hacks . Hack 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . Decidable problems can be used to solve simple yes or no problems. Examples of a decidable problem would be: . Is it raining? | Is it sunny? | Are you in school? | . Undecidable problems don’t provide a yes or no answer and can’t be solved with an algorithm. These problems may be partially decidable but they will never be decidable. Examples of a undecidable problem would be: . God is omnipotent, so can God create a stone that he cannot lift? | . Hack 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 B. 4^5 C. (3 x 8)^2 D. None of the above E. All of the above . C, is a three step algorithm because you first have to multiple 3 x 8 (24) and then multiply 24 times 24 (576). . Hack 3 . . ↑ Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way ↑ . Answer: . . I didn’t quite understand this hack so I looked at the answer, but from looking at the answer I can tell the differences between the code. First and most obviously, the code was compressed into a smaller form and made shorter/simpler to understand while running the same as the lengthened code. The second thing I notice is that the code in the answer didn’t set the counter, peak, or peak_index to 0, I believe this is because the counter can assume that it is starting at 0 rather than having to write it. The next part of the code is the if else functions that become shortened by commands used such as: array.slice, mid_index (middle of the index is used), reversing the array, and finding the peak of the array. Although, I didn’t quite understand I get why making the code shortened is more beneficial to save time and makes the code look clearer and better to process. . Hack 4 . . ↑ Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way ↑ . Answer: . . The code in this could easily have been sorted by using a simple command of creating a variable name and adding a command to sort it. I added my data in a list unsorted, showed it unsorted then proceeded to sort it and show the outcome of it sorted. . Hack 5 . . ↑ Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way ↑ . Answer: . . The code defines the function and then procedes to use iteration to go over data structures of all the different ways the numbers 1, 2, and 3 can be ordered. Then it prints the outcome. Simplified and made easy on the eye! .",

B, because instead of the command being random.random, the command would be just random() with nothing in the paranthesis. You can’t random a random. | . Short Answer Questions . 1) The advantage of a library such as the College Board APCSP Exam Reference Sheet, is that a library shows how code should be and is used. . 2) The first step of the code is to import random library to use throughout the code. Next, the code asks for everybody names in which the person in which the codes waits for the user input to use as list. From there, the code analyzes how many people are in the list and uses a random number generator to find the name via a index from the list. Then that person is set as person_who_will_pay and the code prints the name of the person who will pay. . Coding Challenges! .

Skip Question 1 . 2. . The answer is PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (time/distnace)}. . 3. . James Hunter is looking through his classmate’s program and sees a procedure called heightenEmotions: PROCEDURE heightenEmotions(myEmotion) . { moreEnergy ← CONCAT(myEmotion, “!!!”) . moreVolume ← UPPER(moreEnergy) . RETURN moreVolume } . That procedure manipulates strings using two built-in procedures, CONCAT for concatenating two strings together, and UPPER for converting a string to uppercase. . James Hunter then sees this line of code: . heightenEmotions(“im mad”) . After that line of code runs, will nothing be displayed? . True, because the procedure does not display due to their being no code telling the procedure to display. . 4. .

Then I have to find my two next middle indexes which is where I add 6 and 8 together to get 14 and divide that in a half to get 7. My other half middle index is 4+1= 5 and divided in half is 2.5 which I round up to 3. Since I still have not found 69 I keep going n pick my next middle indexes.

My favorite was the drawn art thought, it was so fun and unique. I feel like art is a great way for people to express themselves and I loved it so much. . My Favorite Art Pieces . A Digestion process of Money . . This photo shows the consumumation of money. I thought this piece of art was so interesting because of the value that money holds to certain people. It reminds me of wealthy eager greedy people who crave money or of those who gamble and throw there money away by having a constant need to have more and more money. I think money is like a hunger. Some people starve for money. Some people have just the right amount. And others overly take money wanting more and more. But in the end everybody knows the digestion system goes, so no matter how much money a greedy person takes, it’ll all go to shit in the end. . Donut . . I really like this picture because the darkness surrounding the donut helps you see how the donut is the subject and center piece of importance in this picture. I also like to intrepret this photo as if invisible people are interrogating this donut seeing as it is under a light, maybe a pressure to say/tell something. This donut itself has its own story. . Man with a Wicked Crown . . I’m not exactly sure what this author is trying to speak about but the art sure did speak to me. The man is staring at me not in a cry for help or with any emotion at all I just see a blank stare. However, the man is surrounded in a jagged crown that is pressing into his head. There is no blood or repurcussion of the crown however you know that it is taking affect upon the man. I find the art interesting because it’s also a combination of drawn and printed I believe. I feel the depth of the painting but I wish I knew what it really meant. . Just Photos . Art . . This is a wall of students art and I really enjoy the one art with the ghosts surrounding the girl who is making paper hearts. It is a unique piece and is cute. Another painting I liked and noticed from this wall is the masks and the two girls being pullled apart from eachother in an unatural way. The art is beautiful and I’m glad that students get to portray their art. . How to Videos . . I believe these projects are from the digital media class and they made How To videos as their project. I watched multiple videos and found them helpful, funny, and creative. These projects seemed super fun and even made me consider taking the class. . Pottery . . This pottery classroom was so cool. Some of the projects were still in progress and some were finished but they were all very nice. My favorite from the table in the photo has to be the octupus. I have no idea how the person made it but it stounds out and is super cool. I hope when I take ceramics, I can make something as unique as that. . Painting and Drawing . . This photo is a showcase of a painting and drawing classroom. The art displayed here had so many colors it felt like I was in a euphoria episode. Besides that the colors were enticing, intriquite, and interesting. I got to see the patterns made from people’s art and studying them was even more fun. This art showed how not all patterns have to be perfect or symmetrical in order to capture the eye or look just as beautiful as symmetrical/perfect art. .",

The purpose ofcomputing innovations is to solve provlems or to pursue interests through creative expression. | An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation. | . Daily Video 2 . Learning Objectives: . Identify input(s) to a program. | Identify output(s) produced by a program. | . Essential Knowledge: . Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. | An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program. | Events acn be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution. | Inputs usually affect the ouput produced by a program. | . Identifying Inputs to Programs . Computer Programs accept input in a variety of different forms: . tactile (touch) | audio | visual | text (including numerical values) | . How do programs recieve input? . Most programs are written in an event driven environment. . &quot;Events&quot; are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program. | . What type of &quot;events&quot; can a user trigger? . mouse clicks | screen taps/swipes (force touch) | physical button clicks | keyboard entries | audio trigger (key word or phrase) | . What does input accomplish in a program? . Input usually affects the output. What are outputs produced by a device? . visual | audio | tactile (touch/feel) | text | . What sort of output do your devices supply? . Smart phone/tablet | Laptop computer | Gaming Console | . How does a program know what to do upon an event? . An action triggers an event: . Action may be initiated by the user or another program/device. | . The program &quot;jumps&quot; to the code segment according to the event: . The code segment is executed. | Output is triggered by the code segment (or additional events are triggered). | . The program code is not necessarily executed &quot;in order&quot;: . Code segments are executed as they are called, according to the events triggered. | . Daily Video 3 . Learning Objectives: . Explain how a prgoram or code segment functions. | . Essential Knowledge: . A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referreed to as software. | A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program. | A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations. | The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it. | A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statemtsn accomplish this function. | . What is a program? . A program is a collection of statements. . A statement is a single command. | A group of statements is called a code segment. | Code segments are executed according to the rules of the programming language. | A program is often referred to as software. | . How can we describe this code segment? . The description should: . Simply state what it does so that someone could use the code segment in a larger program | . | Or include how it does what it does: by explaining in detail how the code segment functions | . | . 1.3 Notes . Daily Video 1 . Learning Objectives: . Develop a program using a development process. | Design a program and its user interface. | . Essential Knowledge . A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature. | There ar emultiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program: investigation and reglecting | designing | prototyping | testing | . | A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process. | A development process that is incrememntal is one that breaks the problem in to smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole. | The design of a program incoroporates investigation to determine its requirements. | Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraits, as well as the concerns and interests of the people hwo will use the program. | Some ways investigation can be [erformed are as follows: collecting data through surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide. | A program&#39;s specification defines the requirements for the program. | In a development process, the dsign phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification. | The design phase of a program may include: brainstorming | planning and storyboarding | organizing the program into modules and funtional components | creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface | development of a testing strategy for the program | . | . How is a program developed? . It starts with an idea. . Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind. | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan. | Sometimes the development is more exploratory tahn anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad). Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants. | . | . How is a program developed? . Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect. . Investigation is an important step in the process. | Developers must: determine the requirements of the program | understand the constraints | understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate? surverys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | . After initial investigation and reflection, . Developers design the program by . brainstorming (draw on ingestigation) | storyboarding the program | planning user experience | laying out the user interface | organizing into modules | develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that . describe how a program should behave | include a list of user interactions | . | The programs specifications outline all of the requirements. | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): an incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program | . | . Testing, testing, and more testing! . Developers test the program every step of the way. | Testing occurs at the micro level | macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection. | . Daily Video 2 . Learning Objectives . Acknowledge code segments used from other sources. | . Essential Knowledge . It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source. | Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the origin or original author&#39;s name. | . How is aprogram developed? . Program development is rarely a solo endeavor. . Programs are usually developed by teams of peoplle. | Individuals/teams work on different functional components. | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work. | Their names must e written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project. | . While documentation is an important place to give credit: . Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit. | This is an important part of the development of the program. | When developers find a bug (or an error in a program), they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem. | This may be most useful after program is completed, and users find additional bugs. | . Many times developers use code segments, procedures, alogrithms, and and more that are written by others. . These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited. | This is similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article. | Any code segments, procedures, algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author. | The program documentation should influde the author&#39;s name and the source of any code segments being used. | This portion of the documentaion may resemble a bibliography or a works cited page in a research paper. | . Daily Video 3 . Lesson Objectives . Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation. | . Essential Knowledge . Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed. | Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs. | Programmers should document a program throughout its development. | Program documentation helps in developing and maintaininig correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments. | Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be rquired. | . How is a program developed? . Programmers create something called program documentation in order to: . describe the overall program | list program specifications | describe: functions/procedures/methods within the code | specific code segments | list of events and corresponding outputs | the development of the program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list of contributors/authors of the program | . When does documentation happen? . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: . At the beginning: list of specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throught can improve: | efficiency of overall programming process | programmers&#39; ability to test and refine the program | programmers&#39; response to bugs | . How do programmers document while programming? . Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not. . Commenting allows programmers to write text within the program. | This text does not affect the program. | Comments are for programmers to read. | This is a form of ocumentation and can be very useful when programmers collaborate or work individually. | . Collaboration . My team collaborated mostly by helping each other out through slack and exchanging messages. We also created the flask project together and I shared that to my teammates. I think we did really well and I really hope that we get an A you know what I mean. Although we ran into some difficulties as a team, we were able to work out our differences. . What was mostly hard was being a team of 3 girls and 1 guy. I&#39;m sure Dylan suffered a little but we were able to get through this pretty nicely and our team is very nice you know. I couldn&#39;t of done this without them and I&#39;m very grateful for them. . Success as a Team . Our successful areas were in: . Communication (bare minnimum i guess) | Socializing | Teamwork | Helping each other | Finding people to help us | Slayyying | . Improvements . Things we could improve on are: . Communication | Talk less, work more | Helping each other | Slayyying (you can always slay more) | Finding more people to help us again (the more the merrier) | . Yea, that&#39;s it!! GO TEAM!!! .",

            "content": "Design . Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of this program was to create a simple, fun, and educational quiz about colors. . Code that makes the function: . onEvent | console.log | setScreen | . The onEvent function was used to describe an even that ocurred along with what made that event happen. In my program, I mainly used the onEvent button to start a function that would lead to the effects of a button being clicked. I start the onEvent by declaring what page or what button the event is happening on and what will happen to that page or button. . From there, I have my function which includes both a console.log and setScreen piece of code. console.log is a piece of code that tells you what your code is doing in your console. I start with a console.log to log what my code is doing so I can easily track my code. Next, I used a setScreen piece of code because each button in my quiz lead to a different page; setScreen basically sets the screen after I run the onEvent. For example, in my code if you clicked a correct answer, it brought you to the correct answer page. . Data Abstraction . In my quiz, all of my data is stored in the console because I used the console.log code to track what my code was doing. . Succeses . Programming . Overall, I think I did really well creating a simple quiz with code. I used most of the same repititionary code to finish this quiz easily and had a lot of fun. . Organizing . I mostly enjoyed organizing my code by adding comments and using the command console.log to log things in my console. I couldn&#39;t have been more happy with how my simple quiz turned out! :) .",

            "content": "Why I like Cross Country . Cross Country is a team based sport that tests your mental toughness to its limits. It is a horrible sport in all honesty and it would be a lie if I were to say I loved it. But I do... at times. I love the sport because I get to hangout with my friends and some part of running relaxes me becase it takes my mind off of worrying about school while I&#39;m running at practice. . Running isn&#39;t easy though, as I said. It&#39;s a mentally toughening sport and at times you&#39;ll definitely want to give up. I like the challenge though and even though I&#39;m dying throughout all the workouts, I like the feeling of accomplishment of being done. . Benefits of Cross Country . There are many benefits of cross country. Here is what I think I benefit from: . ‣ You can stay fit. . ‣ You get to make lots of new friends. . ‣ It&#39;s a lot of fun. . ‣ Helps reduce stress/takes your mind off things. . ‣ You become mentally tougher. . ‣ You learn about running and form. . Teammates and Good Sportsmanship . It&#39;s important to bond as a team and lift each other up because as I said before... this sport is not easy at all. Along with this, you should have good sportsmanship because almost every other runner feels the same way you feel during a race. It&#39;s ok to celebrate after, of course, but congratulate others as well before you do. Running 3 miles isn&#39;t easy so you should celebrate with those around you rather than doing it alone. It&#39;s easy to make friends with people from the other team by simply saying, &quot;Good Job!&quot; Almost everybody in cross country is positive and uplifting (which also makes it easier to interact with other teams/people). .",

In this example I am importing from a library called &quot;os&quot;, this library extracts properties from the operating system of my existing system. Python and Jupyter docs requires you to reference imports and definitions above the referencing line of code. . Import os, sys obtain functions and variables from running environment | Print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable + &quot; on &quot; + sys.platform + &quot;!&quot;), is a concatenated statement that outputs properties from the import . My example defines a new function &quot;question_with_response&quot;, this function returns a value input by the user. This allows the programmer to evaluate the response. The purpose of obtaining the return value is to evaluate if the correct response was given to the question. . Response from &quot;question_with_response&quot; is captured in a variable called &quot;rsp&quot; return command in function returns msg input by user | assignment to &quot;rsp&quot; is allowed a function is returning a value, names do not need to match (but could) | . | . | If command is next command in sequence after &quot;rsp&quot; assignment . this command contains an expression, rsp == &quot;import&quot; which compare what is typed to the string literal answer | an if expression is evaluated for true or false | true takes branch of code directly under if | false takes branch of code directly under else command | . | The grand finally of this example is calculating the right/total. . question = 3 is defined as number of questions | correct = 0 is defined as running score | correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation | since question and correct are numbers, versus strings, to place them in concatenation in print statements you must inclose them in Python function str() which turns number into string. | final print statement is concatenated and formatted to give user and right over wrong | . | . My Python Quiz Example: . import getpass, sys #create function question_with_response def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg #create variables for questions and number of correct questions = 6 correct = 0 #create function question_and_answer def question_and_answer(prompt): msg = input() return msg #start quiz by saying hi to user and asking if they are ready to take the test print(&#39;Hey, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable) print(&quot;You will be asked &quot; + str(questions) + &quot; questions.

Hey, najafonseca running /usr/local/bin/python3 You will be asked 6 questions. Are you ready to take a fun test!? :D Respond with &#39;ok&#39; to continue. Question: What command is used to include other functions that are developed? import is correct! Question: What command in this example is used to evaluate a response? if is correct! Question: Each &#39;if&#39; command contains an &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition? expression is correct! The next 3 set of questions will be True or False. Please respond with either capital &#39;True&#39; or &#39;False&#39; Good luck and good job so far! Question: True or False: The print command outputs the paramater to the terminal. True is correct! Question: True or False: Output in Jupyter is below the code cell. True is correct! Question: True or False: Static text changes. False is correct! najafonseca you scored 6/6 . Notes and Vocabulary for Week 2 . Lists and Dictionaries . Lists and Dictionaries are used to store or collect information. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. . | A lists data type is: class &#39;list&#39; . | &#39;.append(expression)&#39; allows you to add to the list | . A list of dictionaries will be the output of the code below: . InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Naja&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Fonseca&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;September 20, 2007&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Hobbies&quot;: &quot;Running and Coloring&quot;, }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) . [{&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Naja&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Fonseca&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;September 20, 2007&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Hobbies&#39;: &#39;Running and Coloring&#39;}] . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Hobbies&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output Naja Fonseca Residence: San Diego Birth Day: September 20, 2007 R, u, n, n, i, n, g, , a, n, d, , C, o, l, o, r, i, n, g . The print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. The for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. I activated my function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. . Agile Methodology . 7 Important Transferable Skills Notes . 1. Creativity . Creativity is mostly seen as how you approach tasks and solve problems. If you solve even the smallest problem, you’ve demonstrated creativity. This skill scales up: Big problems are enlarged small problems; small problems scaled up are big problems. . Creativity includes: . Conceptualize problems and solutions | Display foresight | Make connections | Make intelligent inferences | Synthesize ideas and data | . 2. Critical Thinking . Solving complex or abstract problems requires critical thinking. . The ability to take a step back and look at things more critically and say ‘Where might we have to have gotten this wrong?’ or ‘How might we be able to improve this?’ is critical thinking. If you can articulate this skill you will stand out! | Critical thinkers head off problems before they arise. And if they do surface, they take them head-on. | . Be a critical thinker and you&#39;ll be able to face any problem! . 3. Communication . Effective communication is VERY important. Communication is KEY! Without effective communication, your team is doomed and so is everyone else who works with you. . Important communication skills include: . Verbal: speakinging clearly and sometimes being repetitive. | Listening: learning to be quiet and listen with your eyes and ears. | Writing: Taking notes are good writing skills. | Technological: Being able to work through technical problems as a team and discussing them with teammates. | . 4. Collaboration and thorough Leadership . Leadership skills generally encompass communication, problem-solving and managing conflict, relationship building and being able to get people on your team on board with a mission or project. Leaders should be inclusive, kind, and make good decisions that will benefit their team. . Leadership skills: . Delegating responsibility | Demonstrating effective time management | Initiating new ideas | Major decision-making | Managing conflict | Managing groups | Multitasking | Teaching and mentoring | . 5. Collaboration through Teamwork . Teammwork is very important to be able to work well with others. Trust is the major difference between working alone versus working in groups. And trust can be hard: Some people are skeptical by nature or want to work through an entire project lifecycle solo. But placing trust in an active, dynamic team provides more than just project completion. Teamwork — a sense of community — elevates spirits and improves productivity. . Working as a Team includes: . Accepting responsibility | Making and implementing decisions | Managing time wisely | Meeting both short- and long-term goals | Organizing | Setting and meeting deadlines | . 6. Researching . Every step in technology made requires research. Research is a key part of the lifecycle: changing plans, fluctuating results, and roadblocks require research before anyone can take action. Interacting with your teammates and collaborating also counts as research. . Researching includes: . Analyzing information | Brainstorming solutions | Delineating needs and requirements | Extracting information from data | Gathering information | Forecasting possible roadblocks | Setting goals | Solving problems | . 7. Technical . Try to stay current with the many technical advancements on your project. This includes collaborating with your teammates to make sure you&#39;re all caught up and on the same page as them. Be knowledgeable and speak to the technical things that you are learning. . Technical skills include: . Being easy to work with | Having the ability to learn quickly | Being excited/happy to learn | Failing and Fixing | Being willing to try new things | Willing to open new doors in case of a drastic oversight | .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .

The function of this game will be for entertainment purposes. An example of a game like ours is google snake. . Data Abstraction . Apart of our data complexity will be when the snake goes for its food/target, it will need to be added to the snakes length. This is a form of data abstraction because we are adding to a body. We will have to name the variable body, representing the body of the snake and this data will represent the amount of points a user gets based on how many targets the user gets. . Managing Complexity . We will use managing complexity to stay organized and seperate the variables from one another. . Procedural Abstraction . Our procedural abstraction will be the affect of the user using the arrow keys to make the snake move in a certain direction. Along with, the snake running into a wall will cause the game to be over. This procedure will contribute to the game because it allows the user to interact with the game (wouldn’t really be a game without it). . Algorithm Implementation . An ineration in our code would be the continuos gain of points by the user when it hits/reaches the target. The sequencing of the snake when it reaches the target, the addition to the body of the snake must be added to the head of the snake. . Testing . We will test our program by running the game and looking for errors, if there is an error, we will problem solve and add/delete to fix our situation. .",

WHAT IF, one of them was even… this hypothetical leads to me being right. | . Q2 Documentation for procedure with add and div . How was I supposed to know that a number divided by 0 would come out as an error? I was not informed that comp sci was a math class. If I was, I would of had these skills available to solve the question AND would of gotten it right. | . Program Function and Purpose Quiz . Q1 Behavior of code that multiplies inside a loop .

Learning Objectives: . Develop a program using a development process. | Design a program and its user interface. | . Essential Knowledge . A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature. | There ar emultiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program: investigation and reglecting | designing | prototyping | testing | . | A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process. | A development process that is incrememntal is one that breaks the problem in to smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole. | The design of a program incoroporates investigation to determine its requirements. | Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraits, as well as the concerns and interests of the people hwo will use the program. | Some ways investigation can be [erformed are as follows: collecting data through surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide. | A program’s specification defines the requirements for the program. | In a development process, the dsign phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification. | The design phase of a program may include: brainstorming | planning and storyboarding | organizing the program into modules and funtional components | creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface | development of a testing strategy for the program | . | . How is a program developed? . It starts with an idea. . Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind. | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan. | Sometimes the development is more exploratory tahn anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad). Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants. | . | . How is a program developed? . Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect. . Investigation is an important step in the process. | Developers must: determine the requirements of the program | understand the constraints | understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate? surverys | user testing | interviews | direct observations After initial investigation and reflection, | . | Developers design the program by brainstorming (draw on ingestigation) | storyboarding the program | planning user experience | laying out the user interface | organizing into modules | develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that describe how a program should behave | include a list of user interactions | . | The programs specifications outline all of the requirements. | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): an incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program Testing, testing, and more testing! | . | Developers test the program every step of the way. | Testing occurs at the micro level | macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection. | . Daily Video 2 . Learning Objectives . Acknowledge code segments used from other sources. | . Essential Knowledge . It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source. | Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the origin or original author’s name. | . How is aprogram developed? . Program development is rarely a solo endeavor. . Programs are usually developed by teams of peoplle. | Individuals/teams work on different functional components. | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work. | Their names must e written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project. While documentation is an important place to give credit: | Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit. | This is an important part of the development of the program. | When developers find a bug (or an error in a program), they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem. | This may be most useful after program is completed, and users find additional bugs. Many times developers use code segments, procedures, alogrithms, and and more that are written by others. | These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited. | This is similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article. | Any code segments, procedures, algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author. | The program documentation should influde the author’s name and the source of any code segments being used. | This portion of the documentaion may resemble a bibliography or a works cited page in a research paper. | . Daily Video 3 . Lesson Objectives . Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation. | . Essential Knowledge . Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed. | Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs. | Programmers should document a program throughout its development. | Program documentation helps in developing and maintaininig correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments. | Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be rquired. | . How is a program developed? . Programmers create something called program documentation in order to: . describe the overall program | list program specifications | describe: functions/procedures/methods within the code | specific code segments | list of events and corresponding outputs | the development of the program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list of contributors/authors of the program | . When does documentation happen? . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: . At the beginning: list of specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throught can improve: | efficiency of overall programming process | programmers’ ability to test and refine the program | programmers’ response to bugs | . How do programmers document while programming? . Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not. . Commenting allows programmers to write text within the program. | This text does not affect the program. | Comments are for programmers to read. | This is a form of ocumentation and can be very useful when programmers collaborate or work individually. | .",
