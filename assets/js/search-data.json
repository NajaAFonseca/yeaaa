The ability to process data depends on the capabilities of the users and their tools. | Data sets pose challenges regardless of size, such as: the need to clean data | incomplete data | invalid data | the need to combine data sources | . | Depending on how data is collected, it may not be uniformed | Cleaning data is a process that makes the data uniform without changing their meaning. | Problems of bias are often created by the type or source of data being collected. Bias is not eliminated by simply collecting more data. | The size of data affects the amount of information that can be extracted from it. | Large data sets are hard to process using a single computer and may require parallel systems. | Scalability of systems is an important consideration when working with data sets, as the computational capacity of a system affects how data sets can be processed and stored. | . Where do we start with data? . Collecting Data: . Issues to consider: . Source What is the source? | Do you need more sources? | . | What tools do you have to analyze? | .

Describe what information can be extracted from data | Describe what information can be extracted from metadata | . Essential Knowledge . Information is the collection of facts and patterns extracted from data. | Data provides oppurtunities for identifying trends, making connections, + addressing problems | Digitally processed data may show correlation between variables. A correlation found in data does not necessarily indicate that a casual relationship exists. Additional research is needed to understand the exact nature of the relationship. | Often a single source does not contain the data needed to draw a onclusion | Metadata is data about data | Changes and deletions to metadata do not change the primary data | Metadata is used for finding, organizing, + managing information | Metadata can increase the use of effective use of data or data sets by providing additional information | Metadata allow data to be structured + organized | . What is metadata? . Prefix meta behind, among, between | metadata = behind the scenes data | . | Some data has information about itself Author | Date | Length/Size | . | Why care about this? helps identify information | track/organize | process | . | . Examples of metadata . Data - photo/image Date | Time | Location | Height | Width | Pixels | Types of compression | . | Data - Book/Document Author | Title | Genre | Date of Publication | Length | . | How might this be used?

Question 1: A researcher is analyzing data about students in a school district to determine whether there is a relationship between grade point average and number of absences. The researcher plans on compiling data from several sources to create a record for each student. . The researcher has access to a database with the following information about each student. . Last name | First name | Grade level (9, 10, 11, or 12) | Grade point average (on a 0.0 to 4.0 scale) | The researcher also has access to another database with the following information about each student. . | First name | Last name | Number of absences from school | Number of late arrivals to school | . Upon compiling the data, the researcher identifies a problem due to the fact that neither data source uses a unique ID number for each student. Which of the following best describes the problem caused by the lack of unique ID numbers? . Students who have the same name may be confused with each other. . | Students who have the same grade point average may be confused with each other. . | Students who have the same grade level may be confused with each other. . | Students who have the same number of absences may be confused with each other. . | My Answer: . 1, because it is possible that students have the same first name and last name. . Correct Answer: . Question 2: A team of researchers wants to create a program to analyze the amount of pollution reported in roughly 3,000 counties across the United States. The program is intended to combine county data sets and then process the data. Which of the following is most likely to be a challenge in creating the program? . A computer program cannot combine data from different files. . | Different counties may organize data in different ways. . | The number of counties is too large for the program to process. . | The total number of rows of data is too large for the program to process. . | My Answer: . 2, because within data sets there are problems with cleaning data and making it accurate. . Correct Answer: . . Question 3: A student is creating a Web site that is intended to display information about a city based on a city name that a user enters in a text field. Which of the following are likely to be challenges associated with processing city names that users might provide as input? . Select two answers. . Users might attempt to use the Web site to search for multiple cities. . | Users might enter abbreviations for the names of cities. . | Users might misspell the name of the city. . | Users might be slow at typing a city name in the text field. . | My Answer: . 2 and 3 because they seem the most reasonable when it comes to challenges, Cities like LA is an abbrievation for Los Angeles. And misspelling is a common human error. . Correct Answer: . Already Correct! . Question 4: A database of information about shows at a concert venue contains the following information. . Name of artist performing at the show | Date of show | Total dollar amount of all tickets sold | . Which of the following additional pieces of information would be most useful in determining the artist with the greatest attendance during a particular month? . Average ticket price . | Length of the show in minutes . | Start time of the show . | Total dollar amount of food and drinks sold during the show . | My Answer: . It could be 1 or 4 because normally more expensive tickets mean a better/popularer artist, but that is a Bias so I’m going to choose 4. . Correct Answer: . 1, The total dollar amount of food and drinks sold during a show may be correlated with the attendance at the show, but cannot be used to determine the exact number of attendees. . Question 5: A camera mounted on the dashboard of a car captures an image of the view from the driver’s seat every second. Each image is stored as data. Along with each image, the camera also captures and stores the car’s speed, the date and time, and the car’s GPS location as metadata. Which of the following can best be determined using only the data and none of the metadata? . The average number of hours per day that the car is in use . | The car’s average speed on a particular day . | The distance the car traveled on a particular day . | The number of bicycles the car passed on a particular day . | My Answer: . 2, I used the process of elimination, it could be one but im thinking it’s 2 more because the speed is one of the more important pieces of data. Distance can’t be captured because we are only using data and not metadata. And the number of biciycles seems kind of random. . Correct Answer: . 4, The calculation of average speed would be based on speed and time, which are part of the metadata. . Question 6: A teacher sends students an anonymous survey in order to learn more about the students’ work habits. The survey contains the following questions. . On average, how long does homework take you each night (in minutes) ? | On average, how long do you study for each test (in minutes) ? | Do you enjoy the subject material of this class (yes or no) ? | . Which of the following questions about the students who responded to the survey can the teacher answer by analyzing the survey results? . I. Do students who enjoy the subject material tend to spend more time on homework each night than the other students do? II. Do students who spend more time on homework each night tend to spend less time studying for tests than the other students do? III. Do students who spend more time studying for tests tend to earn higher grades in the class than the other students do? . I only | III only | I and II | I and III | My Answer: . 3, because both correlate to the questions the teacher asked. . Correct Answer: . Already Correct!! .",

            "title": "Data Structures- Space and Time Complexity",
            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. Space complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. It is also usually expressed using big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the amount of memory used by the algorithm as the size of the input increases. . Big O Notation . Constant Time O(1) | Linear Time O(n) | Quadratic Time O(n^2) | Logarithmic Time O(logn) | Exponential time (O(2^n)) | . numbers = list(range(1000)) . Constant Time O(1) . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) . Linear Time O(n) . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Quadratic Time O(n^2) . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Logarithmic Time O(logn) . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . import time def constant_time(numbers, target): print(numbers[target]) start_time = time.time() constant_time(numbers, 263) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) . 263 Time taken: 0.00010228157043457031 seconds .",

Compare data compression algorithms to determine which is best in a particular context . | Data compression can reduce the size of transmitted or stored data | Fewer bits does not = less info | The amount of size reduction from compression depends on both the amount of redundancy in the original data representation and the compression algorithm applied | Lossless data compression can usually reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted while gauranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data | Lossy data compression algorithms can significally reduce he number of bits stored or transmitted but only allow reconstruction of an approxomation of the original data | Lossy data compression algorithms can usually reduce the number of its stored or transmitted more than lossless compression algorithms | In situations where quality or ability to reconstruct the original is maximally important, lossless compression algorithms are typically chosen | In situations where minimizing data size or transmission time is maximally important, lossy compression algorithms are typically chosen | . What is Data Compression?: . a reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data | used to save transmission time and storage space | . How Does Compression Work? . When data is compressed, you are looking for repeated patterns and predictability | The larger the data file, the more patterns that can be pulled out | . Test Compression . Remove all repeated characters and insert a single character or symbol in its | . Data Compression Methods: Lossless vs Lossy . Lossless: reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted while guaranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data. | Lossy: significicantly reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted but only allow reconstruction of an approxomation of the original data. | . Lossy vs Lossless . Lossless: . The typical approach where the loss of words or numbers would change the information Executable files | Text | Spreadsheet files | . | . Lossy: . The typical approach where the removal of some data has little or no discernible effect on the representation of the content since the data removed are redundant, unimportant or imperceptible Graphics | Audio | Video | Images | . | . Which is Better? . All data compression algorithms have trade offs. Lossy data compression can reduce the data more than lossless but the original data can not be recovered | Lossless data compression lets you restore and recover the original data but it can’t be compressed as much as lossy algorithms | . | Need to recover the original? Choose Lossless! | . | Data size or transmission time is important? Choose Lossy! | . | . Quiz! . Question 1: Which of the following is an advantage of a lossless compression algorithm over a lossy compression algorithm? . A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee that compressed information is kept secure, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot. . | A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee reconstruction of original data, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot. . | A lossless compression algorithm typically allows for faster transmission speeds than does a lossy compression algorithm. . | A lossless compression algorithm typically provides a greater reduction in the number of bits stored or transmitted than does a lossy compression algorithm. . | My Answer: . 2, because while both compress lossless does not extract and remove useless data, it compresses the data and can confirm that all data will be able to be reconstructed. . Correction: . Already Correct!!! . Question 2: A user wants to save a data file on an online storage site. The user wants to reduce the size of the file, if possible, and wants to be able to completely restore the file to its original version. Which of the following actions best supports the user’s needs? . Compressing the file using a lossless compression algorithm before uploading it . | Compressing the file using a lossy compression algorithm before uploading it . | Compressing the file using both lossy and lossless compression algorithms before uploading it . | Uploading the original file without using any compression algorithm . | My Answer: . 1, because if the user wants to reduce the size of the file and wants to be able to completely restore the file to its original version then lossless is the best option. . Correction: . Already Correct!!! . Question 3: A programmer is developing software for a social media platform. The programmer is planning to use compression when users send attachments to other users. Which of the following is a true statement about the use of compression? . Lossless compression of video files will generally save more space than lossy compression of video files. . | Lossless compression of an image file will generally result in a file that is equal in size to the original file. . | Lossy compression of an image file generally provides a greater reduction in transmission time than lossless compression does. . | Sound clips compressed with lossy compression for storage on the platform can be restored to their original quality when they are played. . | My Answer: . 3, because 1 is wrong because lossy compresses more because it’s able to delete data that is not needed, 2 is wrong because compression of a lossless file results in it being smaller than the original, and 4 is wrong because lossy deletes data that is not needed therefore the sound clip would not be restored to its original size. . Correction: . Already Correct!!! .",

The purpose of this program is so users who want to visit places in San Diego can filter activities that cater more to their liking, making it easier for them to find activities to participate in. . Function: . The functionality of this program is going to be the users ability to select different activities, manage a budget, + preferred duration time of an activity through a dropdown menu. The user would then press “filter or “filter activities” and the activities would proceed to filter based on the selections of the user. . Data Abstraction . Two code segments: . A list that is going to show how data is going to be stored will be the list of activities and places to visit in San Diego when added into our API. The use of this list will be showed when a student presses filter to see certain activities filtered. . Identifies the name of the variable: . I plan on naming the list of activities in my API as activities . Describes the data in the list: . The list will contain data describing the activities because in order for the user to be able to sort through certain activites, each list will have to be asssigned a activity category, budget, and duration time. . Managing Complexity . List used to manage comlpexity: . The list used to manage complexity will be the one that filters activities, budget, + duration time in the drop down menus. . Explain how the list manages complexity: . The list manages comlexity because it will filter activities in the API and without it the code would be unable to filter the activities at all. . Procedural Abstraction . Student-developed procedure: . A student-developed procedure that I’m thinking I could use is one that would run what would happen if a user were to select an activity from the dropdown menus (of activity, budget, or time). When the user selects it, the drop down menu will need to save the students option and the code will need to too. When the code saves all of these the user will be able to filter without the code forgetting their options. The procedure will be called when the user clicks the selected dropdown option. . Functionality: . This procedure contributes to the functionality because when the user selects something from the dropdown menu it will need to be saved in order for the activities to filter, if not the activities may not oiutput at all or all activities will show. . Algorithm Implementation . Student-developed algorithm . The list that will sort through activities will be used to demonstrate sequincing, selection, + iteration. . Testing . In my written response I will identify two calls to the procedure and describe the condition(s) being tested by each call. And I will identify the result of each call. .",

Big Post Reflection . Three Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing . Beneficial: . A beneficial effect of using computers is the free access to knowledge. | A beneficial effect of using computers is that you can communicate worldwide for work, friends, and/or family. | A beneficial effect of using computers is that you can back up photos and store data. | Harmful: . A harmful effect of using computers is you could get your data stolen or you could get hacked. | A harmful effect of using computers is that you could get addicted to video games or sucked into online media | A harmful effect of using computers is you could get groomed by online predators. | Dopamine Issues . Real? . I believe that dopamine is real and that it does cause many issues, especially in those who use social media. Social media sucks in a lot of people to want more and more. Everytime someone gets ading on their phone, they feel that dopamine rush and excitement that they’ve been notified. For example, likes on posts from social media make many people feel happy or appreciated. . Parent Conspiracy? . Not a parent conspiracy, dopamine has been scientifically proven and their are stories such as Anthony Rosner’s that show the effects of dopamine. . Dopamine in My Life . I feel like I got a lot of dopamine from playing video games and watching TikTok, both which affected my school performance. I would spend 2 hours every night playing video games, which is 10 hours a week. I started playing less and less because I realized how unhealthy this habit was and how much it affected me. I eventually stopped gaming completely and have a healthier school/life balance. With TikTok, I would get so sucked in I would watch it for hours and time would fly by in well… no time. I would be watching at 5pm and then it would be 7pm. So, I deleted TikTok to also benefit my school/life balance. From here I developed healthier habits to help me balance school when I needed a break. I started reading in between hours I would do my homework. I would practice drawing or copy sketches in my notebook as well. These things helped me reduce the addiction of Dopamine, and benefit my daily life. . 5.2 Notes . Digital Divide . Digital divide is the divide between to those who can access computers and those who cannot. . Poorer/rural areas in America may not have less or little access to technology | Some countries may have different or restricted access | . Things that contribute to the Digital Divide . older computers or older technology in general may not have access to the latest updates | regional distinction | school blocked sites and restrictions | . Blog Post Reflection . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . People can empower themself in a digital world by being familiar with simple commands that they can use. For example, when a teacher is going too fast on a lesson and I’m able to access the lesson on my computer I can use command shift + 3 to take a quick screenshot of what the teacher is talking about or going over. Another example, in comp sci when I need to record a video I can use command shift + 5 to screen record. . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . Someone who is empowered in knowledge can help someone that is not empowered by helping students who may be less knowledgable then others. Something I could do at DNHS is tutoring students who are in grades below me or taking classes I’ve previously taken. . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? . I don’t think paper is blcking digital empowerment, but I think red tape could be. If there are steps that you have to complete before doing something it could be lengthening the digital process and slowing down digital empowerment. At Del Norte, there are restrictions that block . 5.3 Summary . I thought each of the excercises were really fun and I enjoyed talking with my classmates and switching talking partners. I liked the answers to a lot of the questions they were innovative and eye opening. When Colin mentioned that Alexa and Siri may have been female voices because women have been seen as the secretary or help it was an impressive conclusion. I also liked hearing about the difference between age groups of Facebook and TikTok. We discussed algorithms that influence ourdecisions like ads and how they push us things the algorithm thinks we would like so we buy it. I also think HP computers are somewhat wrong (but not racist), because I’m sure that they had to do thorough testing in order to see if the face tracking worked. My conclusion is perhaps they did test it on someone who had darker skintone but did not care to write or say that the face tracking would not work on those of darker skin tones. As it would be well, weird. . 5.4 Hacks . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . A crowdsource idea that would initiate our environment is a quiz or quick question. . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . My project would be better with crowdsourcing because I can ask people what their favorite places are in San Diego County and when they answer I can add those places to the API in my travel project. This would help people go to places that they will like/enjoy. . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make the evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . I could capture data such as how many students attend the event to express the joy of coming to N@tM. . 5.5 .

Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video shows input, output and program functionality. Follows written response criteria by dsecribing program purpose, functionality, input, and output. | Video demonstrates running of program, keyboard input, output prompts satisfying video criteria. Wrtitten response criteria met by described functionality, input, output, and program purpose. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 0 | Written response shows two code segments. The response identifies the name of the variable representing the list and describes the data contained in the list. | Two code segments were shown, however the second segment does not showcase data being accessed from the list. Every other requirement is met besides this one. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The student shows a list that manages complexity, but does not explain how it manages complexity because they do not explain why the code could not work without this list or could be written differently. | The student meets neither two criteria. List does not manage complexity because they could use an if statement to set the cpuPlay variable to a random number. Written response of why the code manages complexity is incorrect because what they say is just as easy to develop or maintain as the one with lists. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 0 | The student includes a two code segments: one that shows a student developed procedure with at least one parameter and shows where said procedure is being called. The student also describes the functionality of the program. | The student meets first criteria, but not second. The criteria is not met because the response does not specify how the procedure contributes to the overall program. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Written response includes a student-developed algorithm that includes: sequencing, selection, and iteration. And the student explains in enough detail how the identified algorithm works and someone could recreate it using such info. | The student meets the first criteria of an algorithm with: sequencing, selection, and iteration. The second criteria is also met through the students written response. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The student describes two different calls in answer section 3c each passing a different argument that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute. In answers 3d, the student describes two conditions being tested by each call procedure and identifies the result of each and every call. | Student response describes two calls to the procedure with different arguments, leading to different results. As well as, describing the conditions being tested for the two procedure calls and identifying the results of each call. | . Submission 2 .

Written response describes overall program purpose, functionality, + describes input and output. | The video met all 6 criteria. Vide: input, program functionality, + output. Written: program purpose, functionality, + input/output. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 1 | Written response contains two code segments: one showing how data has been stored in a list and the other showing how the data in the list is being used to fulfill the program purpose. However, does not use name of list being used in reponse and does not describe what the data in the list is representing in the program. | Two distinct code segments, name of list is identified, + response identifies what is stored in the lsit. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | Includes a code segment that is used to manage complexity in the program. And writes about how the code segment would be inefficient without it because of the additional steps it would take to fill in. | Includes a code segment that manages complexity + response explains how the code would be written differently without the list. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The written response includes two code segments: a student-develoepd procedure with at least one parameter + one showing where the student-developed procedure is being called. The student describes what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program. | The response includes a student-developed procedure + response describes the functionality of the procedure. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Includes student-developed code segment that has: sequeincing, iteration, + selection. The student explains in very thorough steps how the identified algorithm works so it is easily recreateable. | The student-developed algorithm within procedure, guessWords, includes sequencing, selection (if statement), and iteration (for loop). And response explains in detail how the algorithm in the procedure works so it can be recreated. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | Describes two calls in response section 3c + describes conditions being tested and identifies the result of each call. | Stupdent response describes two different calls to the specific procedure to result in different code being executed. The student describes the conditions being tested + describes the result of two calls. | . Submission 3 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments College Board Comments . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | Video demonstrates: input, output, + program functionality. Written response describes program purpose, functionality, + input/output. | Written: response specifies the program’s purpose, response describes the functionality demonstrated in the video, + response describes the input and the output. Video: demonstrates the running of the program, showing input into the program using a drop-down list + displaying output results on the screen as a picture of a state flag and other data related to a state such as area and population. | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Two code segments, one shows data being stored in a list, the other does not. Identifies the name of the variable. And response is inaccurate as stateList only contains information following the names of States. | Two distinct code segments are provided, but only the second code segment shows data being stored in the identified list. Name of the list is identified as stateList. Description is inaccurate as the identified list stateList appears to represent only the state name. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | Includes program segment that shows managing comlpexity but written response does not specify a simplified way to write the code or how the code would not work without this code. | The response includes code that uses lists to manage complexity; however, the response does not explain how the specific code cannot be written without a list or would be written in a more complex manner. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Two code segments, lackinga single parameter, and no call is related to the second code segment. Therefore, also inaccurately describing what the identified procedure does and does not answer how it contributes to overall functionality of the program. | The response includes a student-developed procedure, updateScreen, but it does not have any parameter. In addition, the second code segment does not show any call to the procedure updateScreen. The response inaccurately describes the functionality of the procedure + the procedure only sets an index and does not update the state screen. The response does not describe how this procedure contributes to the overall functionality. | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | Includes code segment including: sequencing, iteration, + selection. Does not explainly thoroughly enough that the identified algorithm could be recreated. | The student-developed algorithm within procedure updateScreen includes sequencing, and selection (if/else), but it does not include iteration. The response does not state that the index value is set based on the match and what value is set for each U.S. state. Although it partially explains how the algorithm in updateScreen works. | . Testing | 1 | 0 | Includes answers to both calls, conditions, + results. | However, the response describes two calls from the specified procedure, rather than two calls to the specified procedure. The response describes the two separate operations being performed by the user, not conditions being tested by the given parameter. The response does not specify the result of two calls to the given procedure. | . Submission 4 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments College Board Comments .

Written response includes: input/output, description of program purpose + functionality. | The video demonstrates: the running of the program, input through movement of the boat as the user presses keys, + output includes movement of the boat and the score. Written reponse: specifies the program’s purpose is to “lessen boredom.”, response describes the functionality demonstrated in the video, response describes the input and the output. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Program segments: one that shows how data has been stored in the list + other that shows the same data in the list being used, identifies the name of the variable representing the list, and describes what the data in the list is representing. | Two distinct code segments are provided: first segment shows data being stored in the identified list, second segment shows data being accessed from the identified list in a for loop, name of the list is identified as fishtypes, + response identifies what is stored in the list. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | Shows a list being used to manage complexity + explains how the list makes the code more efficient than taking longer, tedious steps to create the same code in a more complex way. | Student response includes code that uses a list of lists to manage complexity. The main list represents fish, where each list element is also a list that stores the type of fish and the number of that type of fish that are caught + response explains how the code can be written without using lists in a plausible manner. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Program segments: one that shows a student-developed procedure with at least one paramater + one showing where said student-developed procedure is being called. Student describes identified procedure and how it contributes to overall functionality. | Response includes a student-developed procedure, clone+movement+range, with five parameters that are used in the procedure + includes a call in the procedure. Student describes the functionality of the procedure + states how the procedure contributes to the overall functionality of the program. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Code segment: contains sequincing, selection, + iteration. And is explained in detailed steps how identified algorithm works to the point that someone else could recreate it. | Student develoepd procedure: sequencing, selection (if/else statement), and iteration (for loop). And student response explains in detail how the algorithm in the procedure works so it can be recreated. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | Identifies first call, conditions, + result. However, the first calls are misplaced and not answered in section 3c. More importantly though --&gt; | The response does not describe specific arguments that are passed through the parameters. Rather the response explains the alternate coding segments if they were used. The response describes the conditions being tested + describes the code segments rather than the result of the call. | .",

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 0 | I gave them a one because they used input, output, and showed program functionality when they tested their code. in their written response, they specifically state the purpose of the code is to provide information about a triangle based on the input side lengths. | College board states that the written response did not meet the criteria because the written response describes the function and not the program purpose. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The data in the program is used from user input when the code finds the angles of each side of the triangle using sin, cosine, and tangent. The variables are listed as the sides of the triangle: A, B, and C. The data from user input is representing the side lengths of the triangle. Their written response contains two completely distinguishable code segments with descriptions on both code segments of what each list does. | College board says that they named their list, provided their two code segments, and had a good written response all which meet College Board criteria. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 0 | The student shows managing complexity because they include a list that organizes their code and sets it up into a nice form. However, I&#39;m not sure if this list really is beneficial to the code although the purpose says to get information on the triangle based on inputted sidelengths and if the list sideIndex is classifying the different types of triangles then I believe it helps manage complexity. | The student deserved a 0 because despite their 4 classifications, the written response was innacurate. As well as, the student states a line that would actually make their code more difficult to manage without a list. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | I gave the student a one because they show both a student-developed procedure and a parameter that shows the functionality of the procedure. Additionally, the student shows where the procedure is being called and throughly describes the procedure as well as describing how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program. | College Board gave this student a one for their student-developed procedure: ratioCalculate, code fragment that class ratioCalculate, the students description of functionality, and because the students states how the procedure contributes to the overall program. | . Algorithm Implentation | 1 | 1 | I gave the student a one because they show sequencing, selection, and iteration in their code. As well as, explaining in detailed steps how the algorithm works enough that someone could recreate it. | College board gave this student a one because they show sequencing, selection, and iteration in their code through the function ratioCalculate. Next, college board also gave the student a one because of the way they described the algorithm functionality enough so it could be recreated. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | I gave the student a one because in 3c the student shows 2 calls to the selected procedure, each different to produce a different segment of code to execute. The student also describes the conditions being called to each procedure, and all in all the student also shows the result of each call in their video. | College board gave the student a one because they describe two different call procedures: ratioCalculate(3.0,4.0,5.0) and ratioCalculate(1.2, 2.3, 3.4). The students response describes the conditions being tested in the procedure calls and identifies the results of each call. | . Submission 2 . Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments College Board Comments . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The video demonstrates user input, program functionality, and output. In the written response, the student discusses the overall purpose of the program, the functionality of the program, and describes both input and output of the program. | The video demonstrates he running of the program: input comes from user placing tiles on the grid, output comes from display of the simulation. And shows user pause, editing, and replaying simulation. Written response specifies program purpose, describes the functionality, and descrines input and output. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Shows how data has been stored in the list and shows how data in the list is being used. Identifies the names of the variables of each list and thoroughly describes the data that is stored in the list. | The written reponse provided two different code segments, one showing data being stored and another showing it being accessed. The name of the list is identified as startGrid, however the other lists are not considered inside the scoring. And the code identifies what is stored in the list. | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The written response shows the a list being used to manage complexity and explains how the list manages complexity and writes how the code could not be written without the list. | College Board gave the student a 1 becuase they stated the list manages complexity through accessing and storing the status (1 or 0) f 10,800 items. As well as, explaining how the code couldn&#39;t be written without a list. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student shows a student-develoeped procedure that has one parameter that affects the functionality of the procedure and the student shows where the procedure is being called. The student also describes the identified procedures and describes how it contributes to the overall functionality. | The response contais a student-developed procedure: replaceList. And two parameters: current and replacement. And the student creates a call to the procedure. The response also describes the functionalit of the procedure. | . Algorithm Implentation | 1 | 1 | The student includes a photo of the develoepd algorithm that included sequencing, selection, and iteration. Algorithm is detailed enough that someone could recreate it. | The student had a student-developed algorithm within procedure: replaceList. Which included sequencing, selection, and iteration. And the response explains in detail how he algorithm in the procedure works. Explained thoroughly to the point of it being able to be recreated. | . Testing | 1 | 1 | The student describes two calls to the selected procedure that causes a different segment of code to execute with thorough explanation from the student. They also describe the conditions being tested by each call to the procedure. And they identify the result to the call fo each procedure. | Response describes 2 different calls to the specific procedure and describes the condition being tested. And describes the result of the two calls as well as they both lead to 2 different results. | .",

Decidable problems . These are problems for which algorithms can be written to solve/produce a correct output for all possible inputs. They have simple yes or no answers, true or false, even or odd. . Undecidable problems . These are problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer. Cannot be solved with any algorithm. . Hacks . Hack 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . Decidable problems can be used to solve simple yes or no problems. Examples of a decidable problem would be: . Is it raining? | Is it sunny? | Are you in school? | . Undecidable problems don’t provide a yes or no answer and can’t be solved with an algorithm. These problems may be partially decidable but they will never be decidable. Examples of a undecidable problem would be: . God is omnipotent, so can God create a stone that he cannot lift? | . Hack 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 B. 4^5 C. (3 x 8)^2 D. None of the above E. All of the above . C, is a three step algorithm because you first have to multiple 3 x 8 (24) and then multiply 24 times 24 (576). . Hack 3 . . ↑ Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way ↑ . Answer: . . I didn’t quite understand this hack so I looked at the answer, but from looking at the answer I can tell the differences between the code. First and most obviously, the code was compressed into a smaller form and made shorter/simpler to understand while running the same as the lengthened code. The second thing I notice is that the code in the answer didn’t set the counter, peak, or peak_index to 0, I believe this is because the counter can assume that it is starting at 0 rather than having to write it. The next part of the code is the if else functions that become shortened by commands used such as: array.slice, mid_index (middle of the index is used), reversing the array, and finding the peak of the array. Although, I didn’t quite understand I get why making the code shortened is more beneficial to save time and makes the code look clearer and better to process. . Hack 4 . . ↑ Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way ↑ . Answer: . . The code in this could easily have been sorted by using a simple command of creating a variable name and adding a command to sort it. I added my data in a list unsorted, showed it unsorted then proceeded to sort it and show the outcome of it sorted. . Hack 5 . . ↑ Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way ↑ . Answer: . . The code defines the function and then procedes to use iteration to go over data structures of all the different ways the numbers 1, 2, and 3 can be ordered. Then it prints the outcome. Simplified and made easy on the eye! .",

B, because instead of the command being random.random, the command would be just random() with nothing in the paranthesis. You can’t random a random. | . Short Answer Questions . 1) The advantage of a library such as the College Board APCSP Exam Reference Sheet, is that a library shows how code should be and is used. . 2) The first step of the code is to import random library to use throughout the code. Next, the code asks for everybody names in which the person in which the codes waits for the user input to use as list. From there, the code analyzes how many people are in the list and uses a random number generator to find the name via a index from the list. Then that person is set as person_who_will_pay and the code prints the name of the person who will pay. . Coding Challenges! .

Skip Question 1 . 2. . The answer is PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (time/distnace)}. . 3. . James Hunter is looking through his classmate’s program and sees a procedure called heightenEmotions: PROCEDURE heightenEmotions(myEmotion) . { moreEnergy ← CONCAT(myEmotion, “!!!”) . moreVolume ← UPPER(moreEnergy) . RETURN moreVolume } . That procedure manipulates strings using two built-in procedures, CONCAT for concatenating two strings together, and UPPER for converting a string to uppercase. . James Hunter then sees this line of code: . heightenEmotions(“im mad”) . After that line of code runs, will nothing be displayed? . True, because the procedure does not display due to their being no code telling the procedure to display. . 4. .

Then I have to find my two next middle indexes which is where I add 6 and 8 together to get 14 and divide that in a half to get 7. My other half middle index is 4+1= 5 and divided in half is 2.5 which I round up to 3. Since I still have not found 69 I keep going n pick my next middle indexes.

My favorite was the drawn art thought, it was so fun and unique. I feel like art is a great way for people to express themselves and I loved it so much. . My Favorite Art Pieces . A Digestion process of Money . . This photo shows the consumumation of money. I thought this piece of art was so interesting because of the value that money holds to certain people. It reminds me of wealthy eager greedy people who crave money or of those who gamble and throw there money away by having a constant need to have more and more money. I think money is like a hunger. Some people starve for money. Some people have just the right amount. And others overly take money wanting more and more. But in the end everybody knows the digestion system goes, so no matter how much money a greedy person takes, it’ll all go to shit in the end. . Donut . . I really like this picture because the darkness surrounding the donut helps you see how the donut is the subject and center piece of importance in this picture. I also like to intrepret this photo as if invisible people are interrogating this donut seeing as it is under a light, maybe a pressure to say/tell something. This donut itself has its own story. . Man with a Wicked Crown . . I’m not exactly sure what this author is trying to speak about but the art sure did speak to me. The man is staring at me not in a cry for help or with any emotion at all I just see a blank stare. However, the man is surrounded in a jagged crown that is pressing into his head. There is no blood or repurcussion of the crown however you know that it is taking affect upon the man. I find the art interesting because it’s also a combination of drawn and printed I believe. I feel the depth of the painting but I wish I knew what it really meant. . Just Photos . Art . . This is a wall of students art and I really enjoy the one art with the ghosts surrounding the girl who is making paper hearts. It is a unique piece and is cute. Another painting I liked and noticed from this wall is the masks and the two girls being pullled apart from eachother in an unatural way. The art is beautiful and I’m glad that students get to portray their art. . How to Videos . . I believe these projects are from the digital media class and they made How To videos as their project. I watched multiple videos and found them helpful, funny, and creative. These projects seemed super fun and even made me consider taking the class. . Pottery . . This pottery classroom was so cool. Some of the projects were still in progress and some were finished but they were all very nice. My favorite from the table in the photo has to be the octupus. I have no idea how the person made it but it stounds out and is super cool. I hope when I take ceramics, I can make something as unique as that. . Painting and Drawing . . This photo is a showcase of a painting and drawing classroom. The art displayed here had so many colors it felt like I was in a euphoria episode. Besides that the colors were enticing, intriquite, and interesting. I got to see the patterns made from people’s art and studying them was even more fun. This art showed how not all patterns have to be perfect or symmetrical in order to capture the eye or look just as beautiful as symmetrical/perfect art. .",

The purpose ofcomputing innovations is to solve provlems or to pursue interests through creative expression. | An understanding of the purpose of a computing innovation provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation. | . Daily Video 2 . Learning Objectives: . Identify input(s) to a program. | Identify output(s) produced by a program. | . Essential Knowledge: . Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. | An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program. | Events acn be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution. | Inputs usually affect the ouput produced by a program. | . Identifying Inputs to Programs . Computer Programs accept input in a variety of different forms: . tactile (touch) | audio | visual | text (including numerical values) | . How do programs recieve input? . Most programs are written in an event driven environment. . &quot;Events&quot; are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program. | . What type of &quot;events&quot; can a user trigger? . mouse clicks | screen taps/swipes (force touch) | physical button clicks | keyboard entries | audio trigger (key word or phrase) | . What does input accomplish in a program? . Input usually affects the output. What are outputs produced by a device? . visual | audio | tactile (touch/feel) | text | . What sort of output do your devices supply? . Smart phone/tablet | Laptop computer | Gaming Console | . How does a program know what to do upon an event? . An action triggers an event: . Action may be initiated by the user or another program/device. | . The program &quot;jumps&quot; to the code segment according to the event: . The code segment is executed. | Output is triggered by the code segment (or additional events are triggered). | . The program code is not necessarily executed &quot;in order&quot;: . Code segments are executed as they are called, according to the events triggered. | . Daily Video 3 . Learning Objectives: . Explain how a prgoram or code segment functions. | . Essential Knowledge: . A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referreed to as software. | A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program. | A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations. | The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it. | A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statemtsn accomplish this function. | . What is a program? . A program is a collection of statements. . A statement is a single command. | A group of statements is called a code segment. | Code segments are executed according to the rules of the programming language. | A program is often referred to as software. | . How can we describe this code segment? . The description should: . Simply state what it does so that someone could use the code segment in a larger program | . | Or include how it does what it does: by explaining in detail how the code segment functions | . | . 1.3 Notes . Daily Video 1 . Learning Objectives: . Develop a program using a development process. | Design a program and its user interface. | . Essential Knowledge . A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature. | There ar emultiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program: investigation and reglecting | designing | prototyping | testing | . | A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process. | A development process that is incrememntal is one that breaks the problem in to smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole. | The design of a program incoroporates investigation to determine its requirements. | Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraits, as well as the concerns and interests of the people hwo will use the program. | Some ways investigation can be [erformed are as follows: collecting data through surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide. | A program&#39;s specification defines the requirements for the program. | In a development process, the dsign phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification. | The design phase of a program may include: brainstorming | planning and storyboarding | organizing the program into modules and funtional components | creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface | development of a testing strategy for the program | . | . How is a program developed? . It starts with an idea. . Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind. | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan. | Sometimes the development is more exploratory tahn anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad). Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants. | . | . How is a program developed? . Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect. . Investigation is an important step in the process. | Developers must: determine the requirements of the program | understand the constraints | understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate? surverys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | . After initial investigation and reflection, . Developers design the program by . brainstorming (draw on ingestigation) | storyboarding the program | planning user experience | laying out the user interface | organizing into modules | develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that . describe how a program should behave | include a list of user interactions | . | The programs specifications outline all of the requirements. | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): an incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program | . | . Testing, testing, and more testing! . Developers test the program every step of the way. | Testing occurs at the micro level | macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection. | . Daily Video 2 . Learning Objectives . Acknowledge code segments used from other sources. | . Essential Knowledge . It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source. | Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the origin or original author&#39;s name. | . How is aprogram developed? . Program development is rarely a solo endeavor. . Programs are usually developed by teams of peoplle. | Individuals/teams work on different functional components. | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work. | Their names must e written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project. | . While documentation is an important place to give credit: . Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit. | This is an important part of the development of the program. | When developers find a bug (or an error in a program), they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem. | This may be most useful after program is completed, and users find additional bugs. | . Many times developers use code segments, procedures, alogrithms, and and more that are written by others. . These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited. | This is similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article. | Any code segments, procedures, algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author. | The program documentation should influde the author&#39;s name and the source of any code segments being used. | This portion of the documentaion may resemble a bibliography or a works cited page in a research paper. | . Daily Video 3 . Lesson Objectives . Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation. | . Essential Knowledge . Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed. | Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs. | Programmers should document a program throughout its development. | Program documentation helps in developing and maintaininig correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments. | Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be rquired. | . How is a program developed? . Programmers create something called program documentation in order to: . describe the overall program | list program specifications | describe: functions/procedures/methods within the code | specific code segments | list of events and corresponding outputs | the development of the program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list of contributors/authors of the program | . When does documentation happen? . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: . At the beginning: list of specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throught can improve: | efficiency of overall programming process | programmers&#39; ability to test and refine the program | programmers&#39; response to bugs | . How do programmers document while programming? . Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not. . Commenting allows programmers to write text within the program. | This text does not affect the program. | Comments are for programmers to read. | This is a form of ocumentation and can be very useful when programmers collaborate or work individually. | . Collaboration . My team collaborated mostly by helping each other out through slack and exchanging messages. We also created the flask project together and I shared that to my teammates. I think we did really well and I really hope that we get an A you know what I mean. Although we ran into some difficulties as a team, we were able to work out our differences. . What was mostly hard was being a team of 3 girls and 1 guy. I&#39;m sure Dylan suffered a little but we were able to get through this pretty nicely and our team is very nice you know. I couldn&#39;t of done this without them and I&#39;m very grateful for them. . Success as a Team . Our successful areas were in: . Communication (bare minnimum i guess) | Socializing | Teamwork | Helping each other | Finding people to help us | Slayyying | . Improvements . Things we could improve on are: . Communication | Talk less, work more | Helping each other | Slayyying (you can always slay more) | Finding more people to help us again (the more the merrier) | . Yea, that&#39;s it!! GO TEAM!!! .",

            "content": "Design . Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of this program was to create a simple, fun, and educational quiz about colors. . Code that makes the function: . onEvent | console.log | setScreen | . The onEvent function was used to describe an even that ocurred along with what made that event happen. In my program, I mainly used the onEvent button to start a function that would lead to the effects of a button being clicked. I start the onEvent by declaring what page or what button the event is happening on and what will happen to that page or button. . From there, I have my function which includes both a console.log and setScreen piece of code. console.log is a piece of code that tells you what your code is doing in your console. I start with a console.log to log what my code is doing so I can easily track my code. Next, I used a setScreen piece of code because each button in my quiz lead to a different page; setScreen basically sets the screen after I run the onEvent. For example, in my code if you clicked a correct answer, it brought you to the correct answer page. . Data Abstraction . In my quiz, all of my data is stored in the console because I used the console.log code to track what my code was doing. . Succeses . Programming . Overall, I think I did really well creating a simple quiz with code. I used most of the same repititionary code to finish this quiz easily and had a lot of fun. . Organizing . I mostly enjoyed organizing my code by adding comments and using the command console.log to log things in my console. I couldn&#39;t have been more happy with how my simple quiz turned out! :) .",

            "content": "Why I like Cross Country . Cross Country is a team based sport that tests your mental toughness to its limits. It is a horrible sport in all honesty and it would be a lie if I were to say I loved it. But I do... at times. I love the sport because I get to hangout with my friends and some part of running relaxes me becase it takes my mind off of worrying about school while I&#39;m running at practice. . Running isn&#39;t easy though, as I said. It&#39;s a mentally toughening sport and at times you&#39;ll definitely want to give up. I like the challenge though and even though I&#39;m dying throughout all the workouts, I like the feeling of accomplishment of being done. . Benefits of Cross Country . There are many benefits of cross country. Here is what I think I benefit from: . ‣ You can stay fit. . ‣ You get to make lots of new friends. . ‣ It&#39;s a lot of fun. . ‣ Helps reduce stress/takes your mind off things. . ‣ You become mentally tougher. . ‣ You learn about running and form. . Teammates and Good Sportsmanship . It&#39;s important to bond as a team and lift each other up because as I said before... this sport is not easy at all. Along with this, you should have good sportsmanship because almost every other runner feels the same way you feel during a race. It&#39;s ok to celebrate after, of course, but congratulate others as well before you do. Running 3 miles isn&#39;t easy so you should celebrate with those around you rather than doing it alone. It&#39;s easy to make friends with people from the other team by simply saying, &quot;Good Job!&quot; Almost everybody in cross country is positive and uplifting (which also makes it easier to interact with other teams/people). .",

In this example I am importing from a library called &quot;os&quot;, this library extracts properties from the operating system of my existing system. Python and Jupyter docs requires you to reference imports and definitions above the referencing line of code. . Import os, sys obtain functions and variables from running environment | Print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable + &quot; on &quot; + sys.platform + &quot;!&quot;), is a concatenated statement that outputs properties from the import . My example defines a new function &quot;question_with_response&quot;, this function returns a value input by the user. This allows the programmer to evaluate the response. The purpose of obtaining the return value is to evaluate if the correct response was given to the question. . Response from &quot;question_with_response&quot; is captured in a variable called &quot;rsp&quot; return command in function returns msg input by user | assignment to &quot;rsp&quot; is allowed a function is returning a value, names do not need to match (but could) | . | . | If command is next command in sequence after &quot;rsp&quot; assignment . this command contains an expression, rsp == &quot;import&quot; which compare what is typed to the string literal answer | an if expression is evaluated for true or false | true takes branch of code directly under if | false takes branch of code directly under else command | . | The grand finally of this example is calculating the right/total. . question = 3 is defined as number of questions | correct = 0 is defined as running score | correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation | since question and correct are numbers, versus strings, to place them in concatenation in print statements you must inclose them in Python function str() which turns number into string. | final print statement is concatenated and formatted to give user and right over wrong | . | . My Python Quiz Example: . import getpass, sys #create function question_with_response def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg #create variables for questions and number of correct questions = 6 correct = 0 #create function question_and_answer def question_and_answer(prompt): msg = input() return msg #start quiz by saying hi to user and asking if they are ready to take the test print(&#39;Hey, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable) print(&quot;You will be asked &quot; + str(questions) + &quot; questions.

Hey, najafonseca running /usr/local/bin/python3 You will be asked 6 questions. Are you ready to take a fun test!? :D Respond with &#39;ok&#39; to continue. Question: What command is used to include other functions that are developed? import is correct! Question: What command in this example is used to evaluate a response? if is correct! Question: Each &#39;if&#39; command contains an &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition? expression is correct! The next 3 set of questions will be True or False. Please respond with either capital &#39;True&#39; or &#39;False&#39; Good luck and good job so far! Question: True or False: The print command outputs the paramater to the terminal. True is correct! Question: True or False: Output in Jupyter is below the code cell. True is correct! Question: True or False: Static text changes. False is correct! najafonseca you scored 6/6 . Notes and Vocabulary for Week 2 . Lists and Dictionaries . Lists and Dictionaries are used to store or collect information. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. . | A lists data type is: class &#39;list&#39; . | &#39;.append(expression)&#39; allows you to add to the list | . A list of dictionaries will be the output of the code below: . InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Naja&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Fonseca&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;September 20, 2007&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Hobbies&quot;: &quot;Running and Coloring&quot;, }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) . [{&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Naja&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Fonseca&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;September 20, 2007&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Hobbies&#39;: &#39;Running and Coloring&#39;}] . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Hobbies&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output Naja Fonseca Residence: San Diego Birth Day: September 20, 2007 R, u, n, n, i, n, g, , a, n, d, , C, o, l, o, r, i, n, g . The print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. The for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. I activated my function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. . Agile Methodology . 7 Important Transferable Skills Notes . 1. Creativity . Creativity is mostly seen as how you approach tasks and solve problems. If you solve even the smallest problem, you’ve demonstrated creativity. This skill scales up: Big problems are enlarged small problems; small problems scaled up are big problems. . Creativity includes: . Conceptualize problems and solutions | Display foresight | Make connections | Make intelligent inferences | Synthesize ideas and data | . 2. Critical Thinking . Solving complex or abstract problems requires critical thinking. . The ability to take a step back and look at things more critically and say ‘Where might we have to have gotten this wrong?’ or ‘How might we be able to improve this?’ is critical thinking. If you can articulate this skill you will stand out! | Critical thinkers head off problems before they arise. And if they do surface, they take them head-on. | . Be a critical thinker and you&#39;ll be able to face any problem! . 3. Communication . Effective communication is VERY important. Communication is KEY! Without effective communication, your team is doomed and so is everyone else who works with you. . Important communication skills include: . Verbal: speakinging clearly and sometimes being repetitive. | Listening: learning to be quiet and listen with your eyes and ears. | Writing: Taking notes are good writing skills. | Technological: Being able to work through technical problems as a team and discussing them with teammates. | . 4. Collaboration and thorough Leadership . Leadership skills generally encompass communication, problem-solving and managing conflict, relationship building and being able to get people on your team on board with a mission or project. Leaders should be inclusive, kind, and make good decisions that will benefit their team. . Leadership skills: . Delegating responsibility | Demonstrating effective time management | Initiating new ideas | Major decision-making | Managing conflict | Managing groups | Multitasking | Teaching and mentoring | . 5. Collaboration through Teamwork . Teammwork is very important to be able to work well with others. Trust is the major difference between working alone versus working in groups. And trust can be hard: Some people are skeptical by nature or want to work through an entire project lifecycle solo. But placing trust in an active, dynamic team provides more than just project completion. Teamwork — a sense of community — elevates spirits and improves productivity. . Working as a Team includes: . Accepting responsibility | Making and implementing decisions | Managing time wisely | Meeting both short- and long-term goals | Organizing | Setting and meeting deadlines | . 6. Researching . Every step in technology made requires research. Research is a key part of the lifecycle: changing plans, fluctuating results, and roadblocks require research before anyone can take action. Interacting with your teammates and collaborating also counts as research. . Researching includes: . Analyzing information | Brainstorming solutions | Delineating needs and requirements | Extracting information from data | Gathering information | Forecasting possible roadblocks | Setting goals | Solving problems | . 7. Technical . Try to stay current with the many technical advancements on your project. This includes collaborating with your teammates to make sure you&#39;re all caught up and on the same page as them. Be knowledgeable and speak to the technical things that you are learning. . Technical skills include: . Being easy to work with | Having the ability to learn quickly | Being excited/happy to learn | Failing and Fixing | Being willing to try new things | Willing to open new doors in case of a drastic oversight | .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

The function of this game will be for entertainment purposes. An example of a game like ours is google snake. . Data Abstraction . Apart of our data complexity will be when the snake goes for its food/target, it will need to be added to the snakes length. This is a form of data abstraction because we are adding to a body. We will have to name the variable body, representing the body of the snake and this data will represent the amount of points a user gets based on how many targets the user gets. . Managing Complexity . We will use managing complexity to stay organized and seperate the variables from one another. . Procedural Abstraction . Our procedural abstraction will be the affect of the user using the arrow keys to make the snake move in a certain direction. Along with, the snake running into a wall will cause the game to be over. This procedure will contribute to the game because it allows the user to interact with the game (wouldn’t really be a game without it). . Algorithm Implementation . An ineration in our code would be the continuos gain of points by the user when it hits/reaches the target. The sequencing of the snake when it reaches the target, the addition to the body of the snake must be added to the head of the snake. . Testing . We will test our program by running the game and looking for errors, if there is an error, we will problem solve and add/delete to fix our situation. .",

WHAT IF, one of them was even… this hypothetical leads to me being right. | . Q2 Documentation for procedure with add and div . How was I supposed to know that a number divided by 0 would come out as an error? I was not informed that comp sci was a math class.

Learning Objectives: . Develop a program using a development process. | Design a program and its user interface. | . Essential Knowledge . A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature. | There ar emultiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program: investigation and reglecting | designing | prototyping | testing | . | A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process. | A development process that is incrememntal is one that breaks the problem in to smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole. | The design of a program incoroporates investigation to determine its requirements. | Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraits, as well as the concerns and interests of the people hwo will use the program. | Some ways investigation can be [erformed are as follows: collecting data through surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide. | A program’s specification defines the requirements for the program. | In a development process, the dsign phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification. | The design phase of a program may include: brainstorming | planning and storyboarding | organizing the program into modules and funtional components | creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface | development of a testing strategy for the program | . | . How is a program developed? . It starts with an idea. . Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind. | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan. | Sometimes the development is more exploratory tahn anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad). Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants. | . | . How is a program developed? . Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect. . Investigation is an important step in the process. | Developers must: determine the requirements of the program | understand the constraints | understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate? surverys | user testing | interviews | direct observations After initial investigation and reflection, | . | Developers design the program by brainstorming (draw on ingestigation) | storyboarding the program | planning user experience | laying out the user interface | organizing into modules | develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that describe how a program should behave | include a list of user interactions | . | The programs specifications outline all of the requirements. | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): an incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program Testing, testing, and more testing! | . | Developers test the program every step of the way. | Testing occurs at the micro level | macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection. | . Daily Video 2 . Learning Objectives . Acknowledge code segments used from other sources. | . Essential Knowledge . It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source. | Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the origin or original author’s name. | . How is aprogram developed? . Program development is rarely a solo endeavor. . Programs are usually developed by teams of peoplle. | Individuals/teams work on different functional components. | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work. | Their names must e written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project. While documentation is an important place to give credit: | Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit. | This is an important part of the development of the program. | When developers find a bug (or an error in a program), they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem. | This may be most useful after program is completed, and users find additional bugs. Many times developers use code segments, procedures, alogrithms, and and more that are written by others. | These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited. | This is similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article. | Any code segments, procedures, algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author. | The program documentation should influde the author’s name and the source of any code segments being used. | This portion of the documentaion may resemble a bibliography or a works cited page in a research paper. | . Daily Video 3 . Lesson Objectives . Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation. | . Essential Knowledge . Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed. | Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs. | Programmers should document a program throughout its development. | Program documentation helps in developing and maintaininig correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments. | Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be rquired. | . How is a program developed? . Programmers create something called program documentation in order to: . describe the overall program | list program specifications | describe: functions/procedures/methods within the code | specific code segments | list of events and corresponding outputs | the development of the program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list of contributors/authors of the program | . When does documentation happen? . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: . At the beginning: list of specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throught can improve: | efficiency of overall programming process | programmers’ ability to test and refine the program | programmers’ response to bugs | . How do programmers document while programming? . Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not. . Commenting allows programmers to write text within the program. | This text does not affect the program. | Comments are for programmers to read. | This is a form of ocumentation and can be very useful when programmers collaborate or work individually. | .",
