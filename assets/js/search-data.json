JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime.

Collaboration . My team collaborated mostly by helping each other out through slack and exchanging messages. We also created the flask project together and I shared that to my teammates. I think we did really well and I really hope that we get an A you know what I mean. Although we ran into some difficulties as a team, we were able to work out our differences. . What was mostly hard was being a team of 3 girls and 1 guy. I&#39;m sure Dylan suffered a little but we were able to get through this pretty nicely and our team is very nice you know.

            "content": "Design . Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of this program was to create a simple, fun, and educational quiz about colors. . Code that makes the function: . onEvent | console.log | setScreen | . The onEvent function was used to describe an even that ocurred along with what made that event happen. In my program, I mainly used the onEvent button to start a function that would lead to the effects of a button being clicked. I start the onEvent by declaring what page or what button the event is happening on and what will happen to that page or button. . From there, I have my function which includes both a console.log and setScreen piece of code. console.log is a piece of code that tells you what your code is doing in your console. I start with a console.log to log what my code is doing so I can easily track my code. Next, I used a setScreen piece of code because each button in my quiz lead to a different page; setScreen basically sets the screen after I run the onEvent. For example, in my code if you clicked a correct answer, it brought you to the correct answer page. . Data Abstraction . In my quiz, all of my data is stored in the console because I used the console.log code to track what my code was doing. . Succeses . Programming . Overall, I think I did really well creating a simple quiz with code. I used most of the same repititionary code to finish this quiz easily and had a lot of fun. . Organizing . I mostly enjoyed organizing my code by adding comments and using the command console.log to log things in my console. I couldn&#39;t have been more happy with how my simple quiz turned out! :) .",

            "content": "Why I like Cross Country . Cross Country is a team based sport that tests your mental toughness to its limits. It is a horrible sport in all honesty and it would be a lie if I were to say I loved it. But I do... at times. I love the sport because I get to hangout with my friends and some part of running relaxes me becase it takes my mind off of worrying about school while I&#39;m running at practice. . Running isn&#39;t easy though, as I said. It&#39;s a mentally toughening sport and at times you&#39;ll definitely want to give up. I like the challenge though and even though I&#39;m dying throughout all the workouts, I like the feeling of accomplishment of being done. . Benefits of Cross Country . There are many benefits of cross country. Here is what I think I benefit from: . ‣ You can stay fit. . ‣ You get to make lots of new friends. . ‣ It&#39;s a lot of fun. . ‣ Helps reduce stress/takes your mind off things. . ‣ You become mentally tougher. . ‣ You learn about running and form. . Teammates and Good Sportsmanship . It&#39;s important to bond as a team and lift each other up because as I said before... this sport is not easy at all. Along with this, you should have good sportsmanship because almost every other runner feels the same way you feel during a race. It&#39;s ok to celebrate after, of course, but congratulate others as well before you do. Running 3 miles isn&#39;t easy so you should celebrate with those around you rather than doing it alone. It&#39;s easy to make friends with people from the other team by simply saying, &quot;Good Job!&quot; Almost everybody in cross country is positive and uplifting (which also makes it easier to interact with other teams/people). .",

            "content": "Notes + Vocabulary for Week 1 . Vocabulary: . Dynamic code: code that can change. | Static texts: unchanging code. | String: strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks. | Sequence of code: two or more lines of code form a sequence. | . Code: . Print(): outputs code, either strings, numbers, or variables. | Variables: Variables are containers for storing data values. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. | If...else commands: An &quot;if statement&quot; is written by using the if keyword. If statements are used to input if something is to happen, something else will happen. An else statement is if that if does not occur the else statement will occur. | . Introducing Python . Print Functions and Vocab . In python, the first code you learn to print out is a hello world message. Example below: | . print (&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) . &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a string and strings are static texts. | Static texts are called static texts because they do not change. | The print command outputs the message &quot;Hello, World!&quot; | An output is the code that is displayed after it is run. | . Variables, Inputs, and Outputs . Variable example: . msg = &quot;variable example&quot; print (msg) . variable example . In this code, the variable is &quot;variable example&quot; and when you input it as the variable name, &quot;msg,&quot; the print function outputs the input. . Functions . A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result. . functions are defined using the def keyword | To call a function, use the function name followed by paranthesis | . Example: . def my_function(): print(&quot;Hello from a function&quot;) my_function() . Hello from a function . Imports, Selection, and Logical Expressions . In this example I am importing from a library called &quot;os&quot;, this library extracts properties from the operating system of my existing system. Python and Jupyter docs requires you to reference imports and definitions above the referencing line of code. . Import os, sys obtain functions and variables from running environment | Print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable + &quot; on &quot; + sys.platform + &quot;!&quot;), is a concatenated statement that outputs properties from the import . My example defines a new function &quot;question_with_response&quot;, this function returns a value input by the user. This allows the programmer to evaluate the response. The purpose of obtaining the return value is to evaluate if the correct response was given to the question. . Response from &quot;question_with_response&quot; is captured in a variable called &quot;rsp&quot; return command in function returns msg input by user | assignment to &quot;rsp&quot; is allowed a function is returning a value, names do not need to match (but could) | . | . | If command is next command in sequence after &quot;rsp&quot; assignment . this command contains an expression, rsp == &quot;import&quot; which compare what is typed to the string literal answer | an if expression is evaluated for true or false | true takes branch of code directly under if | false takes branch of code directly under else command | . | The grand finally of this example is calculating the right/total. . question = 3 is defined as number of questions | correct = 0 is defined as running score | correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation | since question and correct are numbers, versus strings, to place them in concatenation in print statements you must inclose them in Python function str() which turns number into string. | final print statement is concatenated and formatted to give user and right over wrong | . | .

Hey, najafonseca running /usr/local/bin/python3 You will be asked 6 questions. Are you ready to take a fun test!? :D Respond with &#39;ok&#39; to continue. Question: What command is used to include other functions that are developed? import is correct! Question: What command in this example is used to evaluate a response? if is correct! Question: Each &#39;if&#39; command contains an &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition? expression is correct! The next 3 set of questions will be True or False. Please respond with either capital &#39;True&#39; or &#39;False&#39; Good luck and good job so far! Question: True or False: The print command outputs the paramater to the terminal. True is correct! Question: True or False: Output in Jupyter is below the code cell. True is correct! Question: True or False: Static text changes. False is correct! najafonseca you scored 6/6 . Notes and Vocabulary for Week 2 . Lists and Dictionaries . Lists and Dictionaries are used to store or collect information. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. . | A lists data type is: class &#39;list&#39; . | &#39;.append(expression)&#39; allows you to add to the list | . A list of dictionaries will be the output of the code below: . InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Naja&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Fonseca&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;September 20, 2007&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Hobbies&quot;: &quot;Running and Coloring&quot;, }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) . [{&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Naja&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Fonseca&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;September 20, 2007&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Hobbies&#39;: &#39;Running and Coloring&#39;}] . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Hobbies&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output Naja Fonseca Residence: San Diego Birth Day: September 20, 2007 R, u, n, n, i, n, g, , a, n, d, , C, o, l, o, r, i, n, g . The print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. The for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. I activated my function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Data Abstraction . In my app, all of my data is stored in the console because of the console.log command which tells the console what goes on with each command. . Succeses . Programming .

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
