Daily Video 2 . Learning Objectives: . Identify input(s) to a program. | Identify output(s) produced by a program. | . Essential Knowledge: . Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. | An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program. | Events acn be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution. | Inputs usually affect the ouput produced by a program. | . Identifying Inputs to Programs . Computer Programs accept input in a variety of different forms: . tactile (touch) | audio | visual | text (including numerical values) | . How do programs recieve input? . Most programs are written in an event driven environment. . &quot;Events&quot; are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program. | . What type of &quot;events&quot; can a user trigger? . mouse clicks | screen taps/swipes (force touch) | physical button clicks | keyboard entries | audio trigger (key word or phrase) | . What does input accomplish in a program? . Input usually affects the output. What are outputs produced by a device? . visual | audio | tactile (touch/feel) | text | . What sort of output do your devices supply? . Smart phone/tablet | Laptop computer | Gaming Console | . How does a program know what to do upon an event? . An action triggers an event: . Action may be initiated by the user or another program/device. | . The program &quot;jumps&quot; to the code segment according to the event: . The code segment is executed. | Output is triggered by the code segment (or additional events are triggered). | . The program code is not necessarily executed &quot;in order&quot;: . Code segments are executed as they are called, according to the events triggered. | . Daily Video 3 . Learning Objectives: . Explain how a prgoram or code segment functions. | . Essential Knowledge: . A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referreed to as software. | A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program. | A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations. | The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it. | A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statemtsn accomplish this function. | . What is a program? . A program is a collection of statements. . A statement is a single command. | A group of statements is called a code segment. | Code segments are executed according to the rules of the programming language. | A program is often referred to as software. | . How can we describe this code segment? . The description should: .

Collaboration . My team collaborated mostly by helping each other out through slack and exchanging messages. We also created the flask project together and I shared that to my teammates. I think we did really well and I really hope that we get an A you know what I mean. Although we ran into some difficulties as a team, we were able to work out our differences. . What was mostly hard was being a team of 3 girls and 1 guy. I&#39;m sure Dylan suffered a little but we were able to get through this pretty nicely and our team is very nice you know. I couldn&#39;t of done this without them and I&#39;m very grateful for them. . Success as a Team . Our successful areas were in: . Communication (bare minnimum i guess) | Socializing | Teamwork | Helping each other | Finding people to help us | Slayyying | . Improvements . Things we could improve on are: . Communication | Talk less, work more | Helping each other | Slayyying (you can always slay more) | Finding more people to help us again (the more the merrier) | . Yea, that&#39;s it!! GO TEAM!!! .",

            "content": "Design . Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of this program was to create a simple, fun, and educational quiz about colors. . Code that makes the function: . onEvent | console.log | setScreen | . The onEvent function was used to describe an even that ocurred along with what made that event happen. In my program, I mainly used the onEvent button to start a function that would lead to the effects of a button being clicked. I start the onEvent by declaring what page or what button the event is happening on and what will happen to that page or button. . From there, I have my function which includes both a console.log and setScreen piece of code. console.log is a piece of code that tells you what your code is doing in your console. I start with a console.log to log what my code is doing so I can easily track my code. Next, I used a setScreen piece of code because each button in my quiz lead to a different page; setScreen basically sets the screen after I run the onEvent. For example, in my code if you clicked a correct answer, it brought you to the correct answer page. . Data Abstraction . In my quiz, all of my data is stored in the console because I used the console.log code to track what my code was doing. . Succeses . Programming . Overall, I think I did really well creating a simple quiz with code. I used most of the same repititionary code to finish this quiz easily and had a lot of fun. . Organizing . I mostly enjoyed organizing my code by adding comments and using the command console.log to log things in my console. I couldn&#39;t have been more happy with how my simple quiz turned out! :) .",

            "content": "Why I like Cross Country . Cross Country is a team based sport that tests your mental toughness to its limits. It is a horrible sport in all honesty and it would be a lie if I were to say I loved it. But I do... at times. I love the sport because I get to hangout with my friends and some part of running relaxes me becase it takes my mind off of worrying about school while I&#39;m running at practice. . Running isn&#39;t easy though, as I said. It&#39;s a mentally toughening sport and at times you&#39;ll definitely want to give up. I like the challenge though and even though I&#39;m dying throughout all the workouts, I like the feeling of accomplishment of being done. . Benefits of Cross Country . There are many benefits of cross country. Here is what I think I benefit from: . ‣ You can stay fit. . ‣ You get to make lots of new friends. . ‣ It&#39;s a lot of fun. . ‣ Helps reduce stress/takes your mind off things. . ‣ You become mentally tougher. . ‣ You learn about running and form. . Teammates and Good Sportsmanship . It&#39;s important to bond as a team and lift each other up because as I said before... this sport is not easy at all. Along with this, you should have good sportsmanship because almost every other runner feels the same way you feel during a race. It&#39;s ok to celebrate after, of course, but congratulate others as well before you do. Running 3 miles isn&#39;t easy so you should celebrate with those around you rather than doing it alone. It&#39;s easy to make friends with people from the other team by simply saying, &quot;Good Job!&quot; Almost everybody in cross country is positive and uplifting (which also makes it easier to interact with other teams/people). .",

            "content": "Notes + Vocabulary for Week 1 . Vocabulary: . Dynamic code: code that can change. | Static texts: unchanging code. | String: strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks. | Sequence of code: two or more lines of code form a sequence. | . Code: . Print(): outputs code, either strings, numbers, or variables. | Variables: Variables are containers for storing data values. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. | If...else commands: An &quot;if statement&quot; is written by using the if keyword. If statements are used to input if something is to happen, something else will happen. An else statement is if that if does not occur the else statement will occur. | . Introducing Python . Print Functions and Vocab . In python, the first code you learn to print out is a hello world message. Example below: | . print (&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) . &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a string and strings are static texts. | Static texts are called static texts because they do not change. | The print command outputs the message &quot;Hello, World!&quot; | An output is the code that is displayed after it is run. | . Variables, Inputs, and Outputs . Variable example: . msg = &quot;variable example&quot; print (msg) . variable example . In this code, the variable is &quot;variable example&quot; and when you input it as the variable name, &quot;msg,&quot; the print function outputs the input. . Functions . A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result. . functions are defined using the def keyword | To call a function, use the function name followed by paranthesis | . Example: . def my_function(): print(&quot;Hello from a function&quot;) my_function() . Hello from a function . Imports, Selection, and Logical Expressions . In this example I am importing from a library called &quot;os&quot;, this library extracts properties from the operating system of my existing system. Python and Jupyter docs requires you to reference imports and definitions above the referencing line of code. . Import os, sys obtain functions and variables from running environment | Print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable + &quot; on &quot; + sys.platform + &quot;!&quot;), is a concatenated statement that outputs properties from the import . My example defines a new function &quot;question_with_response&quot;, this function returns a value input by the user. This allows the programmer to evaluate the response. The purpose of obtaining the return value is to evaluate if the correct response was given to the question. . Response from &quot;question_with_response&quot; is captured in a variable called &quot;rsp&quot; return command in function returns msg input by user | assignment to &quot;rsp&quot; is allowed a function is returning a value, names do not need to match (but could) | . | . | If command is next command in sequence after &quot;rsp&quot; assignment . this command contains an expression, rsp == &quot;import&quot; which compare what is typed to the string literal answer | an if expression is evaluated for true or false | true takes branch of code directly under if | false takes branch of code directly under else command | . | The grand finally of this example is calculating the right/total. . question = 3 is defined as number of questions | correct = 0 is defined as running score | correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation | since question and correct are numbers, versus strings, to place them in concatenation in print statements you must inclose them in Python function str() which turns number into string. | final print statement is concatenated and formatted to give user and right over wrong | . | . My Python Quiz Example: . import getpass, sys #create function question_with_response def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg #create variables for questions and number of correct questions = 6 correct = 0 #create function question_and_answer def question_and_answer(prompt): msg = input() return msg #start quiz by saying hi to user and asking if they are ready to take the test print(&#39;Hey, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable) print(&quot;You will be asked &quot; + str(questions) + &quot; questions.

Question: True or False: Output in Jupyter is below the code cell. True is correct! Question: True or False: Static text changes. False is correct! najafonseca you scored 6/6 . Notes and Vocabulary for Week 2 . Lists and Dictionaries . Lists and Dictionaries are used to store or collect information. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. . | A lists data type is: class &#39;list&#39; . | &#39;.append(expression)&#39; allows you to add to the list | . A list of dictionaries will be the output of the code below: . InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Naja&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Fonseca&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;September 20, 2007&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Hobbies&quot;: &quot;Running and Coloring&quot;, }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) . [{&#39;FirstName&#39;: &#39;Naja&#39;, &#39;LastName&#39;: &#39;Fonseca&#39;, &#39;DOB&#39;: &#39;September 20, 2007&#39;, &#39;Residence&#39;: &#39;San Diego&#39;, &#39;Hobbies&#39;: &#39;Running and Coloring&#39;}] . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Hobbies&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output Naja Fonseca Residence: San Diego Birth Day: September 20, 2007 R, u, n, n, i, n, g, , a, n, d, , C, o, l, o, r, i, n, g . The print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. The for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. I activated my function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. . Agile Methodology . 7 Important Transferable Skills Notes . 1. Creativity . Creativity is mostly seen as how you approach tasks and solve problems. If you solve even the smallest problem, you’ve demonstrated creativity. This skill scales up: Big problems are enlarged small problems; small problems scaled up are big problems. . Creativity includes: . Conceptualize problems and solutions | Display foresight | Make connections | Make intelligent inferences | Synthesize ideas and data | . 2. Critical Thinking . Solving complex or abstract problems requires critical thinking. . The ability to take a step back and look at things more critically and say ‘Where might we have to have gotten this wrong?’ or ‘How might we be able to improve this?’ is critical thinking. If you can articulate this skill you will stand out! | Critical thinkers head off problems before they arise. And if they do surface, they take them head-on. | . Be a critical thinker and you&#39;ll be able to face any problem! . 3. Communication . Effective communication is VERY important. Communication is KEY! Without effective communication, your team is doomed and so is everyone else who works with you. . Important communication skills include: . Verbal: speakinging clearly and sometimes being repetitive. | Listening: learning to be quiet and listen with your eyes and ears. | Writing: Taking notes are good writing skills. | Technological: Being able to work through technical problems as a team and discussing them with teammates. | . 4. Collaboration and thorough Leadership . Leadership skills generally encompass communication, problem-solving and managing conflict, relationship building and being able to get people on your team on board with a mission or project. Leaders should be inclusive, kind, and make good decisions that will benefit their team. . Leadership skills: . Delegating responsibility | Demonstrating effective time management | Initiating new ideas | Major decision-making | Managing conflict | Managing groups | Multitasking | Teaching and mentoring | . 5. Collaboration through Teamwork . Teammwork is very important to be able to work well with others. Trust is the major difference between working alone versus working in groups. And trust can be hard: Some people are skeptical by nature or want to work through an entire project lifecycle solo. But placing trust in an active, dynamic team provides more than just project completion. Teamwork — a sense of community — elevates spirits and improves productivity. . Working as a Team includes: . Accepting responsibility | Making and implementing decisions | Managing time wisely | Meeting both short- and long-term goals | Organizing | Setting and meeting deadlines | . 6. Researching . Every step in technology made requires research. Research is a key part of the lifecycle: changing plans, fluctuating results, and roadblocks require research before anyone can take action. Interacting with your teammates and collaborating also counts as research. . Researching includes: . Analyzing information | Brainstorming solutions | Delineating needs and requirements | Extracting information from data | Gathering information | Forecasting possible roadblocks | Setting goals | Solving problems | . 7. Technical . Try to stay current with the many technical advancements on your project. This includes collaborating with your teammates to make sure you&#39;re all caught up and on the same page as them. Be knowledgeable and speak to the technical things that you are learning. . Technical skills include: . Being easy to work with | Having the ability to learn quickly | Being excited/happy to learn | Failing and Fixing | Being willing to try new things | Willing to open new doors in case of a drastic oversight | .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

WHAT IF, one of them was even… this hypothetical leads to me being right. | . Q2 Documentation for procedure with add and div . How was I supposed to know that a number divided by 0 would come out as an error? I was not informed that comp sci was a math class.

Learning Objectives: . Develop a program using a development process. | Design a program and its user interface. | . Essential Knowledge . A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature. | There ar emultiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program: investigation and reglecting | designing | prototyping | testing | . | A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process. | A development process that is incrememntal is one that breaks the problem in to smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole. | The design of a program incoroporates investigation to determine its requirements. | Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraits, as well as the concerns and interests of the people hwo will use the program. | Some ways investigation can be [erformed are as follows: collecting data through surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . | Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide. | A program’s specification defines the requirements for the program. | In a development process, the dsign phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification. | The design phase of a program may include: brainstorming | planning and storyboarding | organizing the program into modules and funtional components | creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface | development of a testing strategy for the program | . | . How is a program developed? . It starts with an idea. . Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind. | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan. | Sometimes the development is more exploratory tahn anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad). Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants. | . | . How is a program developed? . Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect. . Investigation is an important step in the process. | Developers must: determine the requirements of the program | understand the constraints | understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate? surverys | user testing | interviews | direct observations After initial investigation and reflection, | . | Developers design the program by brainstorming (draw on ingestigation) | storyboarding the program | planning user experience | laying out the user interface | organizing into modules | develop a testing strategy | . | Developers decide on the program requirements that describe how a program should behave | include a list of user interactions | . | The programs specifications outline all of the requirements. | Developers create a prototype of the program (or components): an incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program Testing, testing, and more testing! | . | Developers test the program every step of the way. | Testing occurs at the micro level | macro level | . | Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection. | . Daily Video 2 . Learning Objectives . Acknowledge code segments used from other sources. | . Essential Knowledge . It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source. | Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the origin or original author’s name. | . How is aprogram developed? . Program development is rarely a solo endeavor. . Programs are usually developed by teams of peoplle. | Individuals/teams work on different functional components. | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work. | Their names must e written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project. While documentation is an important place to give credit: | Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit. | This is an important part of the development of the program. | When developers find a bug (or an error in a program), they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem. | This may be most useful after program is completed, and users find additional bugs. Many times developers use code segments, procedures, alogrithms, and and more that are written by others. | These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited. | This is similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article. | Any code segments, procedures, algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author. | The program documentation should influde the author’s name and the source of any code segments being used. | This portion of the documentaion may resemble a bibliography or a works cited page in a research paper. | . Daily Video 3 . Lesson Objectives . Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation. | . Essential Knowledge . Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed. | Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs. | Programmers should document a program throughout its development. | Program documentation helps in developing and maintaininig correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments. | Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be rquired. | . How is a program developed? . Programmers create something called program documentation in order to: . describe the overall program | list program specifications | describe: functions/procedures/methods within the code | specific code segments | list of events and corresponding outputs | the development of the program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list of contributors/authors of the program | . When does documentation happen? . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program: . At the beginning: list of specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process Documentation throught can improve: | efficiency of overall programming process | programmers’ ability to test and refine the program | programmers’ response to bugs | . How do programmers document while programming? . Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not. . Commenting allows programmers to write text within the program. | This text does not affect the program. | Comments are for programmers to read. | This is a form of ocumentation and can be very useful when programmers collaborate or work individually. | .",
