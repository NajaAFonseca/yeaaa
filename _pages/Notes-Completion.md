# Questions/Difficulties within the Quiz

#### Collaboration Quiz

Q3 User participation in software development
- N/A, missed question was understandibly incorrect.

#### Program Design and Development Quiz

Q1 Documentation for procedure with a loop
- If I knew how to add, I would of gotten this right. Who knew 1+2 would end up in continuos odd numbers. WHAT IF, one of them was even... this hypothetical leads to me being right.

Q2 Documentation for procedure with add and div
- How was I supposed to know that a number divided by 0 would come out as an error? I was not informed that comp sci was a math class. If I was, I would of had these skills available to solve the question AND would of gotten it right. 

#### Program Function and Purpose Quiz

Q1 Behavior of code that multiplies inside a loop 
- Again, with the mathematics, if I was aware, IF, I would of aced this quiz.

Q2 Behavior of mystery procedure with if statement
- Where does the values of true and false come out? Is this a boolean statement? How was I supposed to tell if it was? 

Q5 How nested loops with lists function
- Makes sense. Would of gotten it right though. Probably just a misclick not gonna lie. 

Q6 Inputs provided by customer on food delivery app
- I thought that the question meant, the credit card or payment info for the purchaser as in the customer giving payment info to the cashregister. If I was an English Major, I would've been able to read. Actually, I wouldn't even be illeterate. Clearly, a question issue, I'm all good though.

# 1.3 Notes

## Daily Video 1

#### Learning Objectives:
- Develop a program using a development process.
- Design a program and its user interface.

#### Essential Knowledge
- A development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature.
- There ar emultiple development processes. The following phases are commonly used when developing a program:
    - investigation and reglecting
    - designing
    - prototyping
    - testing
- A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phases of the process.
- A development process that is incrememntal is one that breaks the problem in to smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole.
- The design of a program incoroporates investigation to determine its requirements.
- Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraits, as well as the concerns and interests of the people hwo will use the program.
- Some ways investigation can be [erformed are as follows:
    - collecting data through surveys
    - user testing
    - interviews
    - direct observations
- Program requirements describe how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide.
- A program's specification defines the requirements for the program.
- In a development process, the dsign phase outlines how to accomplish a given program specification.
- The design phase of a program may include:
    - brainstorming
    - planning and storyboarding
    - organizing the program into modules and funtional components
    - creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface
    - development of a testing strategy for the program

#### How is a program developed?
It starts with an idea.
- Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind.
- Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan.
- Sometimes the development is more exploratory tahn anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad).
    - Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants.

#### How is a program developed?
Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect.
- Investigation is an important step in the process.
- Developers must:
    - determine the requirements of the program
    - understand the constraints
    - understand the user concerns and interests
- How do developers investigate?
    - surverys
    - user testing
    - interviews
    - direct observations
After initial investigation and reflection,
- Developers design the program by
    - brainstorming (draw on ingestigation)
    - storyboarding the program
    - planning user experience
    - laying out the user interface
    - organizing into modules
    - develop a testing strategy
- Developers decide on the program requirements that
    - describe how a program should behave
    - include a list of user interactions
- The programs specifications outline all of the requirements.
- Developers create a prototype of the program (or components):
    - an incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts (modules) of the program
Testing, testing, and more testing!
- Developers test the program every step of the way.
- Testing occurs at the
    - micro level
    - macro level
- Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection.

#### Learning Objectives
- Acknowledge code segments used from other sources.

#### Essential Knowledge
- It is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source.
- Acknowledgement of a code segment(s) written by someone else and used in a program can be in the program documentation. The acknowledgement should include the origin or original author's name.

#### How is aprogram developed?
Program development is rarely a solo endeavor.
- Programs are usually developed by teams of peoplle.
- Individuals/teams work on different functional components.
- Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work.
- Their names must e written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributions to the project.
While documentation is an important place to give credit:
- Many projects use comments within the programming language to give credit.
- This is an important part of the development of the program.
- When developers find a bug (or an error in a program), they need to be able to determine who can/should fix the problem.
- This may be most useful after program is completed, and users find additional bugs.
Many times developers use code segments, procedures, alogrithms, and and more that are written by others.
- These other individuals are not necessarily a part of the project, but they still deserve to be credited.
- This is similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article.
- Any code segments, procedures, algorithms are considered intellectual property of the author.
- The program documentation should influde the author's name and the source of any code segments being used.
- This portion of the documentaion may resemble a bibliography or a works cited page in a research paper.

#### Lesson Objectives
- Describe the purpose of a code segment or program by writing documentation.

#### Essential Knowledge
- Program documentation is a written description of the function of a code segment, event, procedure, or program, and how it was developed.
- Comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not affect how a program runs.
- Programmers should document a program throughout its development.
- Program documentation helps in developing and maintaininig correct programs when working individually or in collaborative programming environments.
- Not all programming environments support comments, so other methods of documentation may be rquired.

#### How is a program developed?
Programmers create something called program documentation in order to:
- describe the overall program
- list program specifications
- describe:
    - functions/procedures/methods within the code
    - specific code segments
    - list of events and corresponding outputs
    - the development of the program
    - how other programs may interact with the program
- list of contributors/authors of the program

#### When does documentation happen?
Documentation happens throughout the development of the program:
- At the beginning: list of specifications
- During: to keep track of process
- After: to explain the overall process
Documentation throught can improve:
- efficiency of overall programming process
- programmers' ability to test and refine the program
- programmers' response to bugs

#### How do programmers document while programming?
Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not.
- Commenting allows programmers to write text within the program.
- This text does not affect the program.
- Comments are for programmers to read.
- This is a form of ocumentation and can be very useful when programmers collaborate or work individually.
