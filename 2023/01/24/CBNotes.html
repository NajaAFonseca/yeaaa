<p>Affects of OpenAI + ChatGPT:</p>

  <li>Affects google, some people wonder if ChatGPT is going to replace google</li>
  <li>ChatGPT is able to assist with coding suggestions and debugging (practically a github copilot)</li>
  <li>Changes the revenue of Google because of a shift from the use of Google to ChatGPT (platform shift)</li>
  <li>Dopamine affects many people, it also is shown to be produced when people play video games or use social media.

<p><strong>Beneficial:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>A beneficial effect of using computers is the free access to knowledge.</li>
  <li>A beneficial effect of using computers is that you can communicate worldwide for work, friends, and/or family.</li>
  <li>A beneficial effect of using computers is that you can back up photos and store data.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Harmful:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>A harmful effect of using computers is you could get your data stolen or you could get hacked.</li>
  <li>A harmful effect of using computers is that you could get addicted to video games or sucked into online media</li>
  <li>A harmful effect of using computers is you could get groomed by online predators.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="dopamine-issues">
<a class="anchor" href="#dopamine-issues" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dopamine Issues</h4>

<p><strong>Real?</strong></p>

<p>I believe that dopamine is real and that it does cause many issues, especially in those who use social media. Social media sucks in a lot of people to want more and more. Everytime someone gets ading on their phone, they feel that dopamine rush and excitement that they’ve been notified. For example, likes on posts from social media make many people feel happy or appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Parent Conspiracy?</strong></p>

<p>Not a parent conspiracy, dopamine has been scientifically proven and their are stories such as Anthony Rosner’s that show the effects of dopamine.</p>

<p><strong>Dopamine in My Life</strong></p>

<p>I feel like I got a lot of dopamine from playing video games and watching TikTok, both which affected my school performance. I would spend 2 hours every night playing video games, which is 10 hours a week. I started playing less and less because I realized how unhealthy this habit was and how much it affected me. I eventually stopped gaming completely and have a healthier school/life balance. With TikTok, I would get so sucked in I would watch it for hours and time would fly by in well… no time. I would be watching at 5pm and then it would be 7pm. So, I deleted TikTok to also benefit my school/life balance. From here I developed healthier habits to help me balance school when I needed a break. I started reading in between hours I would do my homework. I would practice drawing or copy sketches in my notebook as well. These things helped me reduce the addiction of Dopamine, and benefit my daily life.</p>

<h3 id="digital-divide">
<a class="anchor" href="#digital-divide" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Digital Divide</h3>

<p>Digital divide is the divide between to those who can access computers and those who cannot.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Poorer/rural areas in America may not have less or little access to technology</li>
  <li>Some countries may have different or restricted access</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>older computers or older technology in general may not have access to the latest updates</li>
  <li>regional distinction</li>
  <li>school blocked sites and restrictions</li>

<a class="anchor" href="#how-does-someone-empower-themself-in-a-digital-world" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How does someone empower themself in a digital world?</h4>

<p>People can empower themself in a digital world by being familiar with simple commands that they can use. For example, when a teacher is going too fast on a lesson and I’m able to access the lesson on my computer I can use command shift + 3 to take a quick screenshot of what the teacher is talking about or going over. Another example, in comp sci when I need to record a video I can use command shift + 5 to screen record.</p>

Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.</h4>

<p>Someone who is empowered in knowledge can help someone that is not empowered by helping students who may be less knowledgable then others. Something I could do at DNHS is tutoring students who are in grades below me or taking classes I’ve previously taken.</p>

<h4 id="is-paper-or-red-tape-blocking-digital-empowerment-are-there-such-barriers-at-del-norte-elsewhere">

<p>I don’t think paper is blcking digital empowerment, but I think red tape could be. If there are steps that you have to complete before doing something it could be lengthening the digital process and slowing down digital empowerment. At Del Norte, there are restrictions that block</p>
