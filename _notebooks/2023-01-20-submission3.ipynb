Follows written response criteria by dsecribing program purpose, functionality, input, and output. | Video demonstrates running of program, keyboard input, output prompts satisfying video criteria. Wrtitten response criteria met by described functionality, input, output, and program purpose.|\n",
    "|Data Abstraction|1|0|Written response shows two code segments. The response identifies the name of the variable representing the list and describes the data contained in the list. | Two code segments were shown, however the second segment does not showcase data being accessed from the list. Every other requirement is met besides this one. |\n",
    "|Managing Complexity|0|0|The student shows a list that manages complexity, but does not explain how it manages complexity because they do not explain why the code could not work without this list or could be written differently.|The student meets neither two criteria. List does not manage complexity because they could use an if statement to set the cpuPlay variable to a random number. Written response of why the code manages complexity is incorrect because what they say is just as easy to develop or maintain as the one with lists.|\n",
    "|Procedural Abstraction|1|0|The student includes a two code segments: one that shows a student developed procedure with at least one parameter and shows where said procedure is being called. The student also describes the functionality of the program.| The student meets first criteria, but not second. The criteria is not met because the response does not specify how the procedure contributes to the **overall** program.|\n",
    "|Algorithm Implementation|1|1|Written response includes a student-developed algorithm that includes: sequencing, selection, and iteration. And the student explains in enough detail how the identified algorithm works and someone could recreate it using such info.| The student meets the first criteria of an algorithm with: sequencing, selection, and iteration. The second criteria is also met through the students written response.|\n",
    "|Testing|1|1|The student describes two different calls in answer section 3c each passing a different argument that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute. In answers 3d, the student describes two conditions being tested by each call procedure and identifies the result of each and every call.|Student response describes two calls to the procedure with different arguments, leading to different results. As well as, describing the conditions being tested for the two procedure calls and identifying the results of each call.|"

Name of the list is identified as stateList. Description is inaccurate as the identified list stateList appears to represent only the state name.|\n",

In addition, the second code segment does not show any call to the procedure updateScreen.

Does not explainly thoroughly enough that the identified algorithm could be recreated.|The student-developed algorithm within procedure updateScreen includes sequencing, and selection (if/else), but it does not include **iteration**. The response does not state that the index value is set based on the match and what value is set for each U.S. state. Although it partially explains how the algorithm in updateScreen works.|\n",
    "|Testing|1|0|Includes answers to both calls, conditions, + results.|However, the response describes two calls from the specified procedure, rather than two calls to the specified procedure.
