    "- console.log\n",
    "- setScreen\n",

    "The onEvent function was used to describe an even that ocurred along with what made that event happen. In my program, I mainly used the onEvent button to start a function that would lead to the effects of a button being clicked. I start the onEvent by declaring what page or what button the event is happening on and what will happen to that page or button. \n",
    "\n",
    "From there, I have my function which includes both a console.log and setScreen piece of code. console.log is a piece of code that tells you what your code is doing in your console. I start with a console.log to **log** what my code is doing so I can easily track my code. Next, I used a setScreen piece of code because each button in my quiz lead to a different page; setScreen basically sets the screen after I run the onEvent. For example, in my code if you clicked a correct answer, it brought you to the correct answer page. "
