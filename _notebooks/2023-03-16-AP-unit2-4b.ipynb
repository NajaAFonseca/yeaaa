    "\n",
    "**My Opinion**\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this is more effective than object oriented programming and imperitive is easier because it's easier for the way we think. But object oriented programming is better for organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT Reccomendation + Facts**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both object-oriented programming and imperative programming have their own advantages and disadvantages, and which one is \"better\" depends on the specific needs of the project and the personal preferences of the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on describing how a program should perform a certain task through a series of statements or instructions. This approach is typically more procedural and involves managing state and data directly. Imperative programming is often used in low-level programming, such as system programming, because it provides more control over the computer's hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming, on the other hand, is a programming paradigm that focuses on representing entities or objects in the real world as objects in the code. This approach is more declarative and involves defining classes and objects that interact with each other through methods and properties. Object-oriented programming is often used in higher-level programming, such as application programming, because it provides a more modular and organized approach to programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, object-oriented programming tends to be more maintainable and scalable, as it allows for the creation of reusable code and more easily understandable program structure. Imperative programming can be more efficient and low-level, making it more suitable for certain types of applications, such as those that require direct control over hardware resources.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the given statement, the {} brackets contain an expression {uid}, which will be evaluated at runtime to the value of the variable uid. The \"f\" at the beginning of the string tells Python to format the string using this expression.\n",
