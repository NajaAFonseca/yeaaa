    "### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For sequential, parallel, and distributed computing:\n",
    "    - compare problem solutions\n",
    "    - determine the eficiency of solutions and describe benefits and challenges of parallel distributed computing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe benefits and challeneges of parallel and distributed computing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Essential Knowledge:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sequential computing is a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at atime\n",
    "- Parallel computing is a computational model where the program is broken into multiple smaller sequential computing operations, some of which are performed simultaneously\n",
    "- Distributed computing is a computational model in which multiple devices are used to run a program\n",
    "- Comparing efficiency of solutions can be done by comparing the time it takes them to perform the same task\n",
    "- A sequential solution takes as long as the sum of all of its steps\n",
    "- A parallel compution solution takes as long as its sequential tasks plus the longest of its parallel tasks\n",
    "- The \"speedup\" of a parallel solution is measured in the time it took to complete the task sequentially divided by the time it took to complete the task when done in parallel\n",
    "- Parallel computing consists of a parallel portion and a sequential portion\n",
    "- Solutions that use parallel computing can scale more effectively than solutions that use sequential computing\n",
    "Distributed computing allows problems to be solved that could not be solved on a single computer because of either the processing time or the storage needs involved\n",
    "- Distributed computing allows much larger problems to be solved quicker than they could be solved using a single computer\n",
    "- When increasing the use of parallel computing in a solution, the efficiency of the solution is still limited by the sequential portion. This means that at some point, adding parallel portions will no longer meaningfully increase efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequential, Parallel and Distributed Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computer Tasks**\n",
    "- A computer needs to handle many tasks as it operates:\n",
    "    - **System Tasks:** the operating system has dozens of tasks, like scheduling what it will be doing next, managing hardware, working with the network, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **User Tasks:** executing programs that the user has selected, such as running MS Excel and MS Word, or computer games\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tasks need to be **scheduled** by the operating system. Balance tasks so all CPUs are being used evenly and fully.\n",
    "\n",
    "☆ Running tasks can be done sequentially, in parallel, and be distributed to other computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequential Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequential Computing.** Tasks are done one after another, in a sequence. It is a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer works tasks A, B, C, ... one at a time.\n",
    "**Why does a computer use sequential computing to run one task at a time**\n",
    "    - **Limited hardware:** It only has one CPU (older hardware).\n",
    "    - **Tasks are dependent:** Task B depends on Task A, Task C depends on Task B, so the needed order is A, B, and then C. \n",
    "\n",
    "Execution Time: Sequential Operations add up all the individual task execution times. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Task A takes 50ms\n",
    "- Task B takes 40 ms\n",
    "- Task C takes 35 ms\n",
    "- Total processing time is 50ms + 40ms + 35ms = 125 ms\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Sequential Computing as items one at a time on a conveyor belt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallel Computing Pt. 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why Parallel: \n",
    "    - Hardware driven: New hardware has several processors in one system, called cores. 1 CPU can have 64+ cores. Graphics cards for gaming can have thousands of cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Faster Operations: Supercomputers link hundreds of CPUs together to work the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Data Driven: A lot of data can be processed the same way (video gaming), called SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Solutions that use parallel computing can scale more effectively than solutions that use sequential computing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallel Computing Pt. 2\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execution Time:\n",
    "    - Time equals the longest time taken on any given processor.\n",
    "    - A parallel computing solution takes as long as its sequential tasks plus the longest of its parallel tasks.\n",
    "    - Parallel processing works best when the tasks are independent from each other--they don't depend on each other's answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Core 1: Task A takes 45ms\n",
    "- Core 2: Task B takes 50 ms\n",
    "- Core 3: Task C takes 25 ms; task D takes 30ms\n",
    "- Core 4: Task E takes 40 ms\n",
    "\n",
    "Total time needed: 55ms (Core 3 with tasks C and D in sequence)\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Total time is 55ms because that's the longest task, the others will run in parallel but take all Tasks will be done by 55ms\n",
    "\n",
