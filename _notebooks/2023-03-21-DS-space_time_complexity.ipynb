    ">Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the \"Big O\" notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity. Space complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. It is also usually expressed using big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the amount of memory used by the algorithm as the size of the input increases."
