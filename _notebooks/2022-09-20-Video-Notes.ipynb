    "- Identify input(s) to a program.\n",
    "- Identify output(s) produced by a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Essential Knowledge:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text.\n",
    "- An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program.\n",
    "-  Events acn be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution.\n",
    "-  Inputs usually affect the ouput produced by a program. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identifying Inputs to Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer Programs accept input in a variety of different forms:\n",
    "- tactile (touch)\n",

    "#### How do programs recieve input?\n",

    "\n",
    "An action triggers an event:\n",
    "- Action may be initiated by the user or another program/device.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program \"jumps\" to the code segment according to the event:\n",
    "- The code segment is executed.\n",
    "- Output is triggered by the code segment (or additional events are triggered).\n",
    "\n",
    "The program code is not necessarily executed \"in order\":\n",
    "- Code segments are executed as they are called, according to the events triggered.\n",

    "#### Learning Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain how a prgoram or code segment functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Essential Knowledge:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referreed to as software. \n",
    "- A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program.\n",
    "- A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations.\n",
    "- The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it.\n",
    "- A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statemtsn accomplish this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a program?\n",
    "\n",
    "A program is a collection of statements.\n",
    "- A statement is a single command.\n",
    "- A group of statements is called a code segment.\n",
    "- Code segments are executed according to the rules of the programming language.\n",
    "- A program is often referred to as software.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How can we describe this code segment?\n",
    "\n",
    "The description should:\n",
    "- Simply state what it does\n",
    "    - so that someone could use the code segment in a larger program\n",
    "- Or include how it does what it does:\n",
    "    - by explaining in detail how the code segment functions"
