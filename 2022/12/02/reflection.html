<a class="anchor" href="#31-and-32" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.1 and 3.2</h3>

<p>Reflection on our group presentation: I thought we presented really well for the first group and I had a lot of fun. Our presentation was thoroughly planned out and touched all topics of our lesson (lists, binary, data, data abstraction). I was glad that our group made the class laugh and lightened the atmosphere of stress/nervousness of being the first presenting group.</p>

<h3 id="33-and-34">
<a class="anchor" href="#33-and-34" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.3 and 3.4</h3>

<p>My Grade: .9/1</p>

<p>Why: I completed all my notes and answers but should have explained my answers for 3.3 video 2</p>

<p>Reflection: I enjoyed the lesson and thought it was really good. They explained their lesson really well and it was easily understandable. I took notes to keep up with what I learned and payed attention to the best of their ability. I learned about algorithms, iteration, selection, sequincing, arithmic operators, srings, concats, substrings and variables.</p>

<h3 id="35-to-37">
<a class="anchor" href="#35-to-37" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.5 to 3.7</h3>

<p>My Grade: 1/1</p>

<p>Why: My grader said I completed all the notes and the lesson with good notes and completed work.</p>

<p>Reflection: I enjoyed the lesson and thought it was organized and well planned out. It went by really fast and I was a bit confused but the teachers were able to help. I took notes to keep up with the lesson and learned about flow charts, relational operators, logical operators, conditional statements, and nested conditionals.</p>

<h3 id="38-and-310">
<a class="anchor" href="#38-and-310" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.8 and 3.10</h3>

<p>My grade: .9/1</p>

<p>Why: And I quote “Perfect; really efficient/clever way of avoiding an index out of range error.”</p>

<p>Reflection: I enjoyed the lesson, however it was a little confusing due to the pace of which the presenters presented. However, after going through my own notes and completing the hacks I was able to understand the lesson to the fullest of my potential.</p>

<h3 id="39-and-311">
<a class="anchor" href="#39-and-311" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.9 and 3.11</h3>

<p>My grade: .92/1</p>

<p>Why: Took great notes and included vocab, great descriptions and explained each question’s answer well. Good Job!!!</p>

<p>Reflection: I really enjoyed this lesson and the interactions. My favorite part was probably the part where we all rapped it was super enjoyable and fun. I thought the lesson was well paced and overall super fun to have.</p>

<h3 id="312-and-313">
<a class="anchor" href="#312-and-313" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.12 and 3.13</h3>

<p>My grade: .9/1</p>

<p>Why: Added everything need and more. Made answers super simple and understandable.</p>

<p>Reflection: This lesson was really good and well paced, I did get a bit confused but was able to figure things out. I thought the pace was a bit fast but overall it was a good lesson and I learned a lot from it.</p>

<h3 id="314-and-315">
<a class="anchor" href="#314-and-315" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.14 and 3.15</h3>

<p>My grade: .89/1</p>

<p>Why: I completed everything however, I got a multiple choice question wrong.</p>

<p>Reflection: This was a really good lesson, I loved the pace and presentation it was super well done and I really enjoyed it. I learned a lot from the lesson and thought it was so smooth and really well done.</p>

<h3 id="316">
<a class="anchor" href="#316" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.16</h3>

<p>My grade: .85/1</p>

<p>Why: 4/6; Took good notes on the assignment as well as finished the multiple choice</p>

<p>Reflection: This lesson went by really quick, however I learned a lot. I thought their hacks were simple and easy to complete. I got 4/6 on the multiple choice and didn’t do extra credit.</p>

<h3 id="317-and-318">
<a class="anchor" href="#317-and-318" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3.17 and 3.18</h3>

<p>My grade: .9/1</p>

<p>Why: No reflection at the end, but really well-done explanations for each hack and all of the hacks were attempted, most were successful.</p>

<p>Reflection: I thought the lesson was really good and really well paced. The hacks were ok except for hack 3 which I found quite difficult. Despite not being able to do it I wrote about the differences in a lengthened code and the shortened code. I learned a lot from this lesson and enjoyed it.</p>
