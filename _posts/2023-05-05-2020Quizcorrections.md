# Question 1

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/miscount3.jpg)

I got this question wrong because I miscounted the number's of 3s to be multiplied. The correct answer is C because 2 is multiplied repeatedly by 4 3 times. Therefore being 2 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3.

# Question 4

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/overflow.jpg)

I got this question wrong because while fractions are sometimes represented by decimal approximations that are subject to rounding errors, integers are not. The answer C is correct because overflow errors occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value outside the range of numbers that can be represented by a fixed number of bits.
