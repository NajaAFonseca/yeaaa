# Logic Gates Hacks

### **1.How can logic gates be used to execute basic computer functions?(1-2 sentences)**

Logic gates can be combined to form circuits that perform basic computer functions. By manipulating the input signals to these circuits, logic gates can execute various operations and produce output signals that represent the results of those operations.

### **2.What is the difference between boolean operations and logic gates?(1-2 sentences)**

Boolean operations are mathematical operations performed on Boolean variables, whereas logic gates are physical electronic components that implement Boolean functions by controlling the flow of electricity in a circuit. Boolean operations are theoretical concepts used in computer science and mathematics, logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits used in electronic engineering and computer hardware design.
