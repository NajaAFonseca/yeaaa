# Question 10

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tri2q10.jpg)

This is the question I got wrong, the answer A was wrong because the expression (num greater than 15) and (num equals 15) evaluates to true if both conditions are true. Because this is mathematically impossible, this expression will always evaluate to false. However, the original expression (the expression in this problem) evaluates to  true when  numis greater than or equal to 15.

This test went well, I used google to help me on the test and understand the questions. :)
