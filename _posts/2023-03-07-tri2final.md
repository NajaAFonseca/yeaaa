# Question 2

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/3q2.jpg)

I put answer B, the correct answer was A because the IP address of a userâ€™s computer is required for the user to send and receive information on the Internet. The IP address in itself does not contain any extra information about the user.

# Question 10

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/3q10.jpg)

I put answer A, the answer was C, I was wrong because public key encryption is widely used because of the functionality it provides in addressing cybersecurity issues when sending information across the Internet.

# Question 12

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/3q12.jpg)

I put answer B, the answer was A, I was wrong because emails that request the user to click on an unknown link, as well as requests to share password information, are indicative of a phishing attack.

# Question 29

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/3q29.jpg)

I put answer C, the answer was B, I was wrong because the fourth statement assigns the value false to a. The fifth statement assigns the value false to c.

# Question 35

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/3q35.jpg)

I put answer D, the answer was A, I was wrong because for example, when scoreB > scoreC > scoreA, the code segment incorrectly identifies Team C as the winner instead of Team B.

# Question 36

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/3q36.jpg)

I put answer A, the answer was D, I was wrong because code segment III works correctly. Code segment III assigns "C" when the numeric score is less than 80, or "B" if the numeric score is not less than 80 but is less than or equal to 90, or "A" otherwise.

# Question 39

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/3q40.jpg)

I put answer C, the answer was A, I was wrong because inserting this statement between lines 6 and 7 increases the value of count once for each iteration of the outer loop, which results in count being half as large as it should be.

# Reflection

This test went well, I used google to help me on the test and understand the questions.
