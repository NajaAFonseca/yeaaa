## Key Components to How a Computer Works

### RAM, CPU, + Alternate Storage Devices

**What is RAM?**

Random Access Memory (RAM)!

It is a type of computer memory that provides temporary storage for data and instructions that the computer is currently using. When a program or application is opened on a computer, it is loaded into the RAM. The RAM is then used by the computer's CPU (Central Processing Unit) to store and manipulate data and instructions quickly. This is because accessing data from RAM is much faster than accessing it from the computer's hard drive.

RAM is volatile memory, meaning that it loses its contents when the computer is turned off or restarted. This is why the computer needs to load the operating system and other programs into RAM each time it is turned on.

*Note: the amount of RAM on a computer affects its performance, more RAM = better computer*

**What is CPU?**

Central Processing Unit (CPU)!

The primary component in a computer that performs most of the processing tasks. The CPU is a microprocessor chip that is located on the computer's motherboard. It communicates with other components in the computer system such as RAM, hard drives, and input/output devices.

The CPU carries out the instructions provided by software programs, performing arithmetic and logic operations, as well as managing input and output operations. The CPU also controls the clock speed, which is the rate at which it processes instructions The performance of a computer is often measured in terms of the speed and power of the CPU.

*Note: faster CPUs with more cores and higher clock speeds can execute instructions more quickly and handle more complex tasks. Modern CPUs can perform billions of calculations per second, making them incredibly powerful and essential components of modern computing. It is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer because it is responsible for executing instructions and managing the operations of the computer.*

**Alternate Storage Devices**

- Hard Disk Drive (HDD): An HDD is a type of non-volatile storage device that uses magnetic disks to store data. It is commonly used to store the operating system, applications, and user data.

- Solid-State Drive (SSD): An SSD is a type of non-volatile storage device that uses flash memory to store data. It is faster and more reliable than an HDD and is commonly used as the primary storage device in modern computers.

- Optical Disc Drive (ODD): An ODD is a type of storage device that uses optical discs (such as CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs) to store data. It is commonly used to install software, play movies, and store backups.

- USB Flash Drive: A USB flash drive is a type of portable non-volatile storage device that uses flash memory to store data. It is commonly used to transfer data between computers or to store backups.

- Memory Card: A memory card is a type of portable non-volatile storage device that is commonly used in digital cameras, smartphones, and other portable devices to store data such as photos and videos.

- Cloud Storage: Cloud storage is a type of online storage that allows users to store and access their data over the internet. It is commonly used for backup and file-sharing purposes.

### Listing Specifications of your Computer, or Computers if working as Pair/Trio

- Processor GHz: GHz (gigahertz) is a unit of frequency that is commonly used to measure the clock speed of a computer CPU. It represents the number of clock cycles that the CPU can perform in one second, and it is often used as an indicator of the CPU's processing power.
