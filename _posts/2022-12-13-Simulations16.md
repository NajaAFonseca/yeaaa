# Notes

### What is a Simulation?

- simple abstraction of a complicated natural phenomena

### Notes on Simulations

- they are digital
- model real world events
- you should only incorporate necessary details into a simulation
- Simulations can use: 
    - Procedures/iteration
    - Flowcharts
    - Conditionals

### Benefits of Using Simulations

- Don't cost money
- Can be repeated
- Accurately show different outcomes of one simulation
- Won't have safety issues
- Can gather more data with repitition

### True or False

- A Simulation will always have the same result (T/F) **False**
- A simulation investigates a phenomenon without real-world constraints of time, money, or safety **True**
- A simulation has results which are more accurate than an experiment **False**
- A simulation can model real-world events that are not practical for experiments **True**
