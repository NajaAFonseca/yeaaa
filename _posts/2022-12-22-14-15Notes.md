# Notes

## Section 14 Libaries and Documentation

### Vocabulary

- Documentation - text that explains what, how, or the why of your code.

- Application Programming Interface (API) - a type of software through several computers are able to communicate information to each other. Gives specific directions for how procedures that reside in these APIs can be used.

### Key Point

**Reusing code is beneficial.**

## Section 15 Random Values Pt. 1

- randrange

#### Randint

- randint(start, stop)

#### Randrange

- randrange(start, stop, step)


# Hacks

1)
- B, because a and b are used as numbers to generate random integers. and RANDOM randomizes the number in which you set a to b as.  

2)
- A, because 

3)
- 

4)
-
