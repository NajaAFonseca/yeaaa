# Video Notes

### Learning Objectives

- Identify the challenges associated with processing data.

### Essential Knowledge

- The ability to process data depends on the capabilities of the users and their tools.
- Data sets pose challenges regardless of size, such as:
    - the need to clean data
    - incomplete data
    - invalid data
    - the need to combine data sources
- Depending on how data is collected, it may not be uniformed
- Cleaning data is a process that makes the data uniform without changing their meaning.
- Problems of bias are often created by the type or source of data being collected. Bias is not eliminated by simply collecting more data.
- The size of data affects the amount of information that can be extracted from it.
- Large data sets are hard to process using a single computer and may require parallel systems.
- Scalability of systems is an important consideration when working with data sets, as the computational capacity of a system affects how data sets can be processed and stored. 

### Where do we start with data?

**Collecting Data:**

Issues to consider:
- Source
    - What is the source?
    - Do you need more sources?
- What tools do you have to analyze?

**Processing Data is affected by Size:**
- How much information can we get?
- Can one computer handle our task(s)?
    - Maybe we have to use parallel processing
        - Use two or more processors to handle different parts of the task 
        - Check the scalability

**Is there potential Bias?**
- Intentional:
    - Who collected the data?
    - Do they have an agenda?
- Unintentional:
    - How is the data collected?
    - Who collected the data?

**Data Cleaning:**
- Identify incomplete, corrupt, duplicate, or inaccurate records
