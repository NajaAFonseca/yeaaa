# Video Notes

## Daily Video 1

### Learning Objectives

- Identify the challenges associated with processing data.

### Essential Knowledge

- The ability to process data depends on the capabilities of the users and their tools.
- Data sets pose challenges regardless of size, such as:
    - the need to clean data
    - incomplete data
    - invalid data
    - the need to combine data sources
- Depending on how data is collected, it may not be uniformed
- Cleaning data is a process that makes the data uniform without changing their meaning.
- Problems of bias are often created by the type or source of data being collected. Bias is not eliminated by simply collecting more data.
- The size of data affects the amount of information that can be extracted from it.
- Large data sets are hard to process using a single computer and may require parallel systems.
- Scalability of systems is an important consideration when working with data sets, as the computational capacity of a system affects how data sets can be processed and stored. 

### Where do we start with data?

**Collecting Data:**

Issues to consider:
- Source
    - What is the source?
    - Do you need more sources?
- What tools do you have to analyze?

**Processing Data is affected by Size:**
- How much information can we get?
- Can one computer handle our task(s)?
    - Maybe we have to use parallel processing
        - Use two or more processors to handle different parts of the task 
        - Check the scalability

**Is there potential Bias?**
- Intentional:
    - Who collected the data?
    - Do they have an agenda?
- Unintentional:
    - How is the data collected?
    - Who collected the data?

**Data Cleaning:**
- Identify incomplete, corrupt, duplicate, or inaccurate records
- Replacing, modifying, or deleting the "dirty" data
- Be careful about modifying or deleting!
    - Be sure there is a mistake
    - Keep records of what is modified/deleted and WHY
    - Invalid data may need to be modified -- keep from consistent

## Daily Video 2

### Learning Objectives 

- Describe what information can be extracted from data
- Describe what information can be extracted from metadata

### Essential Knowledge

- Information is the collection of facts and patterns extracted from data.
- Data provides oppurtunities for identifying trends, making connections, + addressing problems
- Digitally processed data may show correlation between variables. A correlation found in data does not necessarily indicate that a casual relationship exists. Additional research is needed to understand the exact nature of the relationship. 
- Often a single source does not contain the data needed to draw a onclusion
- Metadata is data about data
- Changes and deletions to metadata do not change the primary data
- Metadata is used for finding, organizing, + managing information
- Metadata can increase the use of effective use of data or data sets by providing additional information
- Metadata allow data to be structured + organized 

### What is metadata?

- Prefix meta
    - behind, among, between
    - metadata = behind the scenes data
- Some data has information about itself
    - Author
    - Date
    - Length/Size
- Why care about this?
    - helps identify information
    - track/organize
    - process

### Examples of metadata

- Data - photo/image
    - Date
    - Time 
    - Location
    - Height
    - Width
    - Pixels
    - Types of compression

- Data - Book/Document
    - Author
    - Title
    - Genre
    - Date of Publication
    - Length
- How might this be used?
    - Suggest Other books
    - Organize inventory

### Finding Patterns

**Data allows us to gain knowledge:**
- Look for trends
- Look for patterns
- Answer questions

- Be careful!
- Look out for misleading trends/patterns
- Correlation does not imply causation

# Quiz!

### Question 1: A researcher is analyzing data about students in a school district to determine whether there is a relationship between grade point average and number of absences. The researcher plans on compiling data from several sources to create a record for each student.

The researcher has access to a database with the following information about each student.

- Last name
- First name
- Grade level (9, 10, 11, or 12)
- Grade point average (on a 0.0 to 4.0 scale)
- The researcher also has access to another database with the following information about each student.

- First name
- Last name
- Number of absences from school
- Number of late arrivals to school

Upon compiling the data, the researcher identifies a problem due to the fact that neither data source uses a unique ID number for each student. Which of the following best describes the problem caused by the lack of unique ID numbers?
