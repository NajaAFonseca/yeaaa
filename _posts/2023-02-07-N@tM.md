This is a photo I took of my comp sci principles class during grading. Everybody is walking around and looking at each others projects.

Here are some photos of photography on the walls at N@tM, all were taken by students and were very pretty.

# 3D Animation

Here are 3D animated pictures of donuts that were created by students. Photo 1 is of multiple donuts in a room. Photo 2 is of a donut interrogation. Photo 3 is of lego people eating donuts.

The next two photos are of digital media students.

Both students created a short film about whatever they wanted. These classes are an easy way students can express creativity and showcase their film making skills.

# Ceramics

The next photos are of ceramics, aka pottery. Photo one just showcases multiple pottery projects made by students. Photo two is of a face eating a dead bird, I'm not wuite sure what this means but it's free for interpretation. Photo 3 was my favorite ceramics project, I really liked the Octupus and the color. Photo four is another picture showcasing multiple pottery projects.
