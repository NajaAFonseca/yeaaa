<li>Identify output(s) produced by a program.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Essential-Knowledge:">Essential Knowledge:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Essential-Knowledge:"> </a></h4><ul>
<li>Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text.</li>
<li>An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program.</li>
<li>Events acn be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution.</li>
<li>Inputs usually affect the ouput produced by a program. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Identifying-Inputs-to-Programs">Identifying Inputs to Programs<a class="anchor-link" href="#Identifying-Inputs-to-Programs"> </a></h4><p>Computer Programs accept input in a variety of different forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>tactile (touch)</li>
<li>audio</li>
<li>visual</li>
<li>text (including numerical values)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="How-do-programs-recieve-input?">How do programs recieve input?<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-do-programs-recieve-input?"> </a></h4><p>Most programs are written in an event driven environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Events" are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program. </li>
</ul>
<p>What type of "events" can a user trigger?</p>
<ul>
<li>mouse clicks</li>
<li>screen taps/swipes (force touch)</li>
<li>physical button clicks</li>
<li>keyboard entries</li>

<ul>
<li>Action may be initiated by the user or another program/device.</li>
</ul>
<p>The program "jumps" to the code segment according to the event:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code segment is executed.</li>
<li>Output is triggered by the code segment (or additional events are triggered).</li>
</ul>
<p>The program code is not necessarily executed "in order":</p>
<ul>
<li>Code segments are executed as they are called, according to the events triggered.</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="Essential-Knowledge:">Essential Knowledge:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Essential-Knowledge:"> </a></h4><ul>
<li>A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referreed to as software. </li>
<li>A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program.</li>
<li>A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations.</li>
<li>The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it.</li>
<li>A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statemtsn accomplish this function.</li>

<h4 id="How-can-we-describe-this-code-segment?">How can we describe this code segment?<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-can-we-describe-this-code-segment?"> </a></h4><p>The description should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply state what it does<ul>
<li>so that someone could use the code segment in a larger program</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or include how it does what it does:<ul>
