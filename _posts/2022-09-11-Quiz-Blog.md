<h2 id="Design">Design<a class="anchor-link" href="#Design"> </a></h2><h3 id="Program-Purpose-and-Function">Program Purpose and Function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Program-Purpose-and-Function"> </a></h3><p>The purpose of this program was to create a simple, fun, and educational quiz about colors.</p>
<p>Code that makes the function:</p>
<ul>
<li>onEvent</li>
<li>console.log</li>
<li>setScreen</li>
</ul>
<p>The onEvent function was used to describe an even that ocurred along with what made that event happen. In my program, I mainly used the onEvent button to start a function that would lead to the effects of a button being clicked. I start the onEvent by declaring what page or what button the event is happening on and what will happen to that page or button.</p>
<p>From there, I have my function which includes both a console.log and setScreen piece of code. console.log is a piece of code that tells you what your code is doing in your console. I start with a console.log to <strong>log</strong> what my code is doing so I can easily track my code. Next, I used a setScreen piece of code because each button in my quiz lead to a different page; setScreen basically sets the screen after I run the onEvent. For example, in my code if you clicked a correct answer, it brought you to the correct answer page.</p>

<h3 id="Data-Abstraction">Data Abstraction<a class="anchor-link" href="#Data-Abstraction"> </a></h3><p>In my quiz, all of my data is stored in the console because I used the console.log code to track what my code was doing.</p>

<h2 id="Succeses">Succeses<a class="anchor-link" href="#Succeses"> </a></h2><h3 id="Programming">Programming<a class="anchor-link" href="#Programming"> </a></h3><p>Overall, I think I did really well creating a simple quiz with code. I used most of the same repititionary code to finish this quiz easily and had a lot of fun.</p>
<h3 id="Organizing">Organizing<a class="anchor-link" href="#Organizing"> </a></h3><p>I mostly enjoyed organizing my code by adding comments and using the command console.log to <strong>log</strong> things in my console. I couldn't have been more happy with how my simple quiz turned out! :)</p>
