# Unit 2 Binary/Data Terms

- **Bits** - the minimum unit of binary information stored in a computer system.
    - Example: 0 or 1.

---

- **Hexadecimal / Nibbles** - each hexadecimal digit represents four bits (binary digits), also known as a nibble (or nybble).

---

- **RGB** - describes a color as a tuple of three components.

## Data Compression: 

- **Lossy** -  file compression describe whether all original data can be recovered when the file is uncompressed.
- **Lossless** - lossless compression, every bit of data originally in a file remains after it is uncompressed, and all the information is restored. Lossy compression reduces a file by permanently eliminating certain information, especially redundant information.

# Unit 3 Algorithm/Programming Terms

- **Variables** - a way of storing information in a computer program, which could later be changed, referenced, and used.
    - Examples: age, gender, name, height
    - Variables can be anything you want to name/make them

---

- **Data Types** - a set of values and operations on those values.

---

- **Assignment Operators** - used to perform operations on variables or operands and assign values to the operand on the left side of the operator.

---

- **Algorithms** - a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/algorithm.jpg)

--- 

- **Sequence** - doing steps in order.
    - Example: following steps 1, 2, and 3. Must go in order!

---

- **Selection** - deciding between two different outcomes. 
    - Example: if else statements offer two different outcomes. 

---

- **Iteration** - repeating a step until the condition is fulfilled.

---
- **Expressions** - a combination of operators and operands. 

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/expression.jpg)

---

- **Comparison Operators** - used to compare two values:

---

- **Booleans Expressions and Iteration** - Expressions that can only result in one of two answers, iteration is the process of iterating between any possible answers.

- **Booleans Expressions and Selection** - Expressions that can only result in one of two answers, selection is the process of selecting one of the two answers.

---

- **Characters** - arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/character.jpg)

---

- **Strings** - strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
    - Example: "Hello", 'hi', "Strings can say anything!"

---

- **Length** - returns the length of an object.
    - Example: len()

--- 

- **Concatenation** - joining strings together end-to-end to create a new string.

- **Lists** - a sequence of several variables grouped together. 
    - Example: list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

---

- **2D Lists** - a two-dimensional data structure stored linearly in the memory.
