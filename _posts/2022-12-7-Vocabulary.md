## Unit 3 Algorithm/Programming Terms

- **Variables** - a way of storing information in a computer program, which could later be changed, referenced, and used.
    - Examples: age, gender, name, height
    - Variables can be anything you want to name/make them

---

- **Data Types** - a set of values and operations on those values.

--- 

- **Sequence** - doing steps in order.
    - Example: following steps 1, 2, and 3. Must go in order!

---

- **Selection** - deciding between two different outcomes. 
    - Example: if else statements offer two different outcomes. 

---

- **Iteration** - repeating a step until the condition is fulfilled.

- **Lists** - a sequence of several variables grouped together. 
    - Example: list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

---

- **2D Lists** - a two-dimensional data structure stored linearly in the memory.
