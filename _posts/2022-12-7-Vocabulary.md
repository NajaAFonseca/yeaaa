## Unit 3 Algorithm/Programming Terms

- **Variables** - a way of storing information in a computer program, which could later be changed, referenced, and used.
    - examples: age, gender, name, height
    - variables can be anything you want to name/make them

---

- **Data Types** - a set of values and operations on those values.

---

- **Assignment Operators** - used to perform operations on variables or operands and assign values to the operand on the left side of the operator.

---

- **Algorithms** - a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.

- **Sequence** - doing steps in order.
    - example: following steps 1, 2, and 3. Must go in order!

---

- **Selection** - deciding between two different outcomes. 
    - example: if else statements offer two different outcomes. 

---

- **Iteration** - repeating a step until the condition is fulfilled.
