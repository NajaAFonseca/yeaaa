## What are Lists?
- Lists are a collection of data in a sequence that is an iterable
- Each sequence is demarcated with an index, starting from 0. This is known as base 0 indexing
- In memory, it is stored as a variable name with multiple pointers to each variable stored in a certain order
- Lists can also be called arrays
- Lists have methods that act upon the list and change them. This moves the pointers within RAM to change the parts of the list.

**A MASSIVE NOTE: Lists methods *Mutate*, meaning they actively change the list, but they don't return anything. This means that return a None-type, which you cannot manipulate**
