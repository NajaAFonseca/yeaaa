### 3.1 and 3.2

Reflection on our group presentation: 

### 3.3 and 3.4 

My Grade: .9/1

Why: I completed all my notes and answers but should have explained my notes for 3.3 video 2

Reflection: I enjoyed the lesson and thought it was really good. They explained their lesson really well and it was easily understandable. I took notes to keep up with what I learned and payed attention to the best of their ability.
