### 3.1 and 3.2

Reflection on our group presentation: I thought we presented really well for the first group and I had a lot of fun. Our presentation was thoroughly planned out and touched all topics of our lesson (lists, binary, data, data abstraction). I was glad that our group made the class laugh and lightened the atmosphere of stress/nervousness of being the first presenting group. 

### 3.3 and 3.4 

My Grade: .9/1

Why: I completed all my notes and answers but should have explained my answers for 3.3 video 2

Reflection: I enjoyed the lesson and thought it was really good. They explained their lesson really well and it was easily understandable. I took notes to keep up with what I learned and payed attention to the best of their ability. I learned about algorithms, iteration, selection, sequincing, arithmic operators, srings, concats, substrings and variables.

### 3.5 to 3.7

My Grade: TBD

Why: --

Reflection: I enjoyed the lesson and thought it was organized and well planned out. It went by really fast and I was a bit confused but the teachers were able to help. I took notes to keep up with the lesson and learned about flow charts, relational operators, logical operators, conditional statements, and nested conditionals.
