### Questions I Got Wrong
 
None :D

### Reflection

I thought the quiz was fairly ok, but for some of the problems I had to google the answer or lok at videos for a greater understanding. I plan on practicing by doing a lot of review for the AP test and watching more helpful videos. I noticed that one of my teammate uses Khan Academy and I think that is a good resource to further my knowledge. I did take the test with my brother so the things I didn't know or he didn't know we asked and explained to each other. I think he would also be a very valuable study tool if he liked me more. It would also lowkey be a great bonding experience. Anyways, test was mid, I should really study, and I'm happy to know that I'm knowledgable.
