### Questio I Got Wrong
 
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q10.jpg)

My answer:  (num greater than 15) and (num equals 15)

Correct answer: (num greater than 15) or (num equals 15)

The expression (num greater than 15) or (num equals 15) evaluates to true if (num greater than 15)is true, or if (num equals 15)is true, or if both are true. The original expressio (the expression in this problem) evaluates to true if  numis greater than or equal to 15.


### Reflection

I thought the quiz was fairly ok, but for some of the problems I had to google the answer or look at videos for a greater understanding. I plan on practicing by doing a lot of review for the AP test and watching more helpful videos. I noticed that one of my teammate uses Khan Academy and I think that is a good resource to further my knowledge. I did take the test with my brother so the things I didn't know or he didn't know we asked and explained to each other. I think he would also be a very valuable study tool if he liked me more. It would also lowkey be a great bonding experience. Anyways, test was mid, I should really study, and I'm happy to know that I'm knowledgable.
