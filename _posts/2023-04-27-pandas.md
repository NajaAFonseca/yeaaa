# Panda hacks

1. What are the two primary data structures in pandas and how do they differ?

The two primary data structures in pandas are Series and DataFrame. A Series represents a single column of data, while a DataFrame represents a whole table of data with rows and columns. A DataFrame can be thought of as a collection of Series objects, where each Series represents a column in the DataFrame, and the row labels are shared between all the columns. In addition, a DataFrame can perform operations that are not possible with a Series, such as joining or merging multiple tables, and grouping or aggregating data based on certain criteria.
