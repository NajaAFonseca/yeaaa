# Panda hacks

### **1. What are the two primary data structures in pandas and how do they differ?**

The two primary data structures in pandas are Series and DataFrame. A Series represents a single column of data, while a DataFrame represents a whole table of data with rows and columns. A DataFrame is like a Series of objects, where each Series represents a column in the DataFrame, and the row labels are shared between all the columns. Also, a DataFrame can perform operations that are not possible with a Series, such as joining or merging multiple tables, and grouping data based on certain criteria.

### **2. How do you read a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame?**

You use the read_csv() function.

### **3. How do you select a single column from a pandas DataFrame?**

You can use square brackets [] with the column name as a string.

Here is an example from chat gpt since my pandas does not work:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/chatgptexample.jpg)

### **4. How do you filter rows in a pandas DataFrame based on a condition?**

You can filter rows in a pandas DataGrame by using the function df_filtered and setting it to the way you want to sort it.

### **5. How do you group rows in a pandas DataFrame by a particular column?**

You group rows in pandas DataFrame by a particular name by adding them to a group such as the code used in your lesson: `age_groups`.

### **6. How do you aggregate data in a pandas DataFrame using functions like sum and mean?**

Aggregating data can be done through DataFrames using sum and mean by using the `groupby()` function and aggregating it after. 

Here is an example from chatgpt:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/chatgptexample2.jpg)

### **7. How do you handle missing values in a pandas DataFrame?**



### **8. How do you merge two pandas DataFrames together?**
### **9. How do you export a pandas DataFrame to a CSV file?**
### **10. What is the difference between a Series and a DataFrame in Pandas?**
