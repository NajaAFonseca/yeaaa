# Panda hacks

### **1. What are the two primary data structures in pandas and how do they differ?**

The two primary data structures in pandas are Series and DataFrame. A Series represents a single column of data, while a DataFrame represents a whole table of data with rows and columns. A DataFrame is like a Series of objects, where each Series represents a column in the DataFrame, and the row labels are shared between all the columns. Also, a DataFrame can perform operations that are not possible with a Series, such as joining or merging multiple tables, and grouping data based on certain criteria.

### **2. How do you read a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame?**

You use the read_csv() function.

### **3. How do you select a single column from a pandas DataFrame?**

You can use square brackets [] with the column name as a string.

Here is an example from chat gpt since my pandas does not work:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/chatgptexample.jpg)

### **4. How do you filter rows in a pandas DataFrame based on a condition?**

You can filter rows in a pandas DataGrame by using the function df_filtered and setting it to the way you want to sort it.

### **5. How do you group rows in a pandas DataFrame by a particular column?**

You group rows in pandas DataFrame by a particular name by adding them to a group such as the code used in your lesson: `age_groups`.

### **6. How do you aggregate data in a pandas DataFrame using functions like sum and mean?**

Aggregating data can be done through DataFrames using sum and mean by using the `groupby()` function and aggregating it after. 

Here is an example from chatgpt:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/chatgptexample2.jpg)

### **7. How do you handle missing values in a pandas DataFrame?**

Missing values in a pandas DataFrame can be handled using various methods. 

### **8. How do you merge two pandas DataFrames together?**

You can merge two pandas DataFrames together using the `merge()` function. The `merge()` function combines DataFrames based on one or more common columns, called keys.

### **9. How do you export a pandas DataFrame to a CSV file?**

You can export a pandas DataFrame to a CSV file using the `to_csv()` function. The `to_csv()` function writes the DataFrame to a comma-separated values (CSV) file.

### **10. What is the difference between a Series and a DataFrame in Pandas?**

In Pandas, a Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type, while a DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different data types.

# Data Analysis + Predictive Analysis

### **1. How can Numpy and Pandas be used to preprocess data for predictive analysis?**

NumPy and Pandas are powerful libraries that can be used to preprocess data for predictive analysis.

### **2. Can you explain the process of building a handwriting recognition system using TensorFlow?**


### **3. What machine learning algorithms can be used for predictive analysis, and how do they differ?**


### **4. Can you discuss some real-world applications of predictive analysis in different industries?**


### **5. How can Numpy and Pandas be used to manipulate and filter data for more accurate predictions?** 


### **6. What are some challenges associated with handwriting recognition, and how can they be overcome?**


### **7. Can you explain the role of feature engineering in predictive analysis, and how it can improve model accuracy?**


### **8. How can machine learning models be deployed in real-time applications for predictive analysis?**


### **9. Can you discuss some limitations of Numpy and Pandas, and when it might be necessary to use other data analysis tools?**


### **10. How can predictive analysis be used to improve decision-making and optimize business processes?**
