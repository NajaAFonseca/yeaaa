# Question 1

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/miscount3.jpg)

I got this question wrong because I miscounted the number's of 3s to be multiplied. The correct answer is C because 2 is multiplied repeatedly by 4 3 times. Therefore being 2 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3.

# Question 4

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/overflow.jpg)

I got this question wrong because while fractions are sometimes represented by decimal approximations that are subject to rounding errors, integers are not. The answer C is correct because overflow errors occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value outside the range of numbers that can be represented by a fixed number of bits.

# Question 22 

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/incorrect.jpg)

I got this question wrong because the code segment I put says that there is a 1/6th chance of "Lose a turn" when the spinner is not cut into 6ths but rather 8ths, in the correct answer here:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/correct.jpg)

you can see why the spinner is the correct answer.

# Question 33

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/assigmentscore.jpg)

I got this question wrong because the change in course grade can actually be calculated by the difference between the original average and the course grade AFTER the lowest grade was dropped. The correct answer was the value of the highest assignment score because we do not know the individual assignment scores making it unable to find any of the individual scores except for the students lowest score. 

# Question 45

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/coinflip.jpg)

I got this question wrong because in this code segment, the variable flip is assigned one of four values: 0, 1, 2, or 3. The player wins approximately two out of every four times (when flip is 0 or 3). However, the desired code segment was supposed to output the players chance of winning when the flip is simulated where one 1 is represented, and the other is represented by 0. The player wins when the sum of these is 0 or 3, indicating all heads or all tails. Which leaves like a 1/4 chance of winning.
