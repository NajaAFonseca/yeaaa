### Program Purpose and Function

The purpose of our program is to create an enjoyable game that is age and user friendly. The function of this game will be for entertainment purposes. An example of a game like ours is google snake. 

### Data Abstraction

Apart of our data complexity will be when the snake goes for its food/target, it will need to be added to the snakes length. This is a form of data abstraction because we are adding to a body. We will have to name the variable body, representing the body of the snake and this data will represent the amount of points a user gets based on how many targets the user gets. 

### Managing Complexity

We will use managing complexity to stay organized and seperate the variables from one another. 

### Procedural Abstraction

Our procedural abstraction will be the affect of the user using the arrow keys to make the snake move in a certain direction. Along with, the snake running into a wall will cause the game to be over. This procedure will contribute to the game because it allows the user to interact with the game (wouldn't really be a game without it).

### Algorithm Implementation 

An ineration in our code would be the continuos gain of points by the user when it hits/reaches the target. The sequencing of the snake when it reaches the target, the addition to the body of the snake must be added to the head of the snake. 

### Testing

We will test our program by running the game and looking for errors, if there is an error, we will problem solve and add/delete to fix our situation.
