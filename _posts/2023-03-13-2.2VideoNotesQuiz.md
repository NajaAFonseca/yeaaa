# Video Notes

### Lesson Objective + Essential Knowledge

- Compare data compression algorithms to determine which is best in a particular context

- Data compression can reduce the size of transmitted or stored data
- Fewer bits does not = less info
- The amount of size reduction from compression depends on both the amount of redundancy in the original data representation and the compression algorithm applied
- Lossless data compression can usually reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted while gauranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data
- Lossy data compression algorithms can significally reduce he number of bits stored or transmitted but only allow reconstruction of an approxomation of the original data
- Lossy data compression algorithms can usually reduce the number of its stored or transmitted more than lossless compression algorithms 
- In situations where quality or ability to reconstruct the original is maximally important, lossless compression algorithms are typically chosen
- In situations where minimizing data size or transmission time is maximally important, lossy compression algorithms are typically chosen

### What is Data Compression?:

- a reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data
- used to save transmission time and storage space

### How Does Compression Work?

- When data is compressed, you are looking for repeated patterns and predictability 
- The larger the data file, the more patterns that can be pulled out

### Test Compression

- Remove all repeated characters and insert a single character or symbol in its

### Data Compression Methods: Lossless vs Lossy
